title: "Sponsor me !"
---

In February 2019,
I switched to a **75% part-time schedule** so that I could spend **one week each month** working on my own stuff at the cost of **slashing a quarter of my wage**.

I spend **all of these weeks** working on opensource software and writing articles,
however I **depend on sponsorship** from the community to maintain that planning.
Without enough sponsors,
I need to **skip some weeks** and take contracts and sponsored developments to cover my expenses.

I opened a [patreon](https://www.patreon.com/gilles)
and registered to the [github sponsoring program](https://github.com/sponsors/poolpOrg)
so that eople who find value in my work can sponsor me and allow me to spend more time publishing stuff for the community.

**<font color="red">For a year, [github](https://github.com/sponsors/poolpOrg) will match your funding.</font>**
Prefer Github over Patreon if you're willing to sponsor me and haven't yet.
If you are already a sponsor on Patreon and don't mind switching to Github,
it will double your contribution at no cost for you.

If you know of companies that could [make use of my skills](https://github.com/poolpOrg/resume/blob/master/resume.en.pdf),
feel free to point them to my [contracting page](/contracting/).
