title: "Sponsor me !"
---

In February 2019,
I switched to a **75% part-time schedule** so that I could spend
**one day each week + one additional day each month** working on my own stuff at the cost of
**slashing a quarter of my wage**.

I spend **all of these days** working on opensource software and writing articles,
however I **depend on sponsorship** from the community to maintain that planning.
Without enough sponsors,
I need to **skip some days** and take contracts and sponsored developments to cover my expenses.

I opened a **[Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/gilles)**,
a **[LiberaPay](https://www.liberapay.com/poolpOrg)**
and registered to the **[Github sponsoring program](https://github.com/sponsors/poolpOrg)**
so that people who find value in my work can sponsor me and allow me to spend more time publishing stuff for the community.

**<font color="red">For a year, **[Github](https://github.com/sponsors/poolpOrg)** will match your funding.</font>**
Prefer Github over Patreon if you're willing to sponsor me and haven't yet.
If you are already a sponsor on Patreon and don't mind switching to Github,
it will double your contribution at no cost for you.
