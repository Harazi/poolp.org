Status: draft


	TL;DR:
  OpenBSD #p2k18 hackathon took place at Epitech in Nantes.
  I was organizing the hackathon but managed to make tremendous progress on OpenSMTPD.
  As mentionned at EuroBSDCon the one-line per rule configuration format was a design error.
  A new configuration grammar is almost ready and the underlying structures are greatly simplified.
  The overall refactor removes ~750 lines of code and solves _several_ issues that were side-effects of design error.
  Development can resume now that we don't have to keep hitting the design error wall over and over.
