Status: draft


    TL;DR:
    OpenBSD #p2k18 hackathon took place at Epitech in Nantes.
    I was organizing the hackathon but managed to make progress on OpenSMTPD.
    As mentionned at EuroBSDCon the one-line per rule config format was a design error.
    A new configuration grammar is almost ready and the underlying structures are simplified.
    Refactor removes ~750 lines of code and solves _many_ issues that were side-effects of the design error.
    New features are going to be unlocked thanks to this.


Anatomy of a design error
--
OpenSMTPD started ten years ago out of dissatisfaction with other solutions,
mainly because I considered them way too complex for me not to get things wrong from time to time.

The initial configuration format was very different,
I was inspired by my pyr@'s `hoststated`, which eventually became `relayd`,
and designed my configuration format with blocks enclosed by brackets.

When I first showed OpenSMTPD to pyr@,
he convinced me that PF-like one-line rules would be awesome,
and it was awesome indeed.

It helped us maintain our goal of simple configuration files,
it helped fight feature creeping,
it helped us gain popularity and become a relevant MTA,
it helped us get where we are now 10 years later.

That being said,
I believe this was a design error.
A design error that could not have been predicted until we hit the wall to understand WHY this was an error.

One-line rules are semantically wrong,
they are SMTP wrong,
they are wrong.

One-line rules are making the entire daemon more complex,
preventing some features from being implemented,
making others more complex than they should be,
they no longer serve our goals.

We should move to two-line rules :-)


SMTP is transactional protocol
--
SMTP is a transactional protocol which considers each message to be part of a transaction with one or many recipients.

A message gets assigned a unique transaction identifier when committed to queue:

    250 2.0.0: 8a2e1208 Message accepted for delivery

That identifier (supposedly) guarantees that the message has been written to disk,
that the mail exchanger takes responsibility not to let it just vanish,
and that recipients sharing the same identifier were part of the same transaction.

This has several side-effects that people are usually unaware of and as I will go deeper in this article,
I will refer back to these side-effects as a reminder.
