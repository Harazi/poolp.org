    TL;DR:
    I'm building a guitar from scratch,
    picking up every component but skipping the tricky cut and glue bits :-)

# About this project

The primary goal of this project is to build a custom guitar,
picking each and every component one by one,
so that it's 100% what I want it to be.

The second goal is to set myself a reasonnable objective,
by not having to cut and glue wood myself,
so that I can see if I like building guitars at all.

The serie will follow this little project,
either to completion or to utter failure,
whichever comes first :-)


# The body
For the body,
I want a traditional shape and since I like PRS SE guitars a lot,
I decided to go with something similar or close.

I wish I knew how to pick wood,
but given that I won't be cutting it myself,
this limited my searches to whatever I could get my hands on conveniently.

I settled on this body which is solid Mahogany and Maple veneer.
Ordered it two days ago from [The Guitar Fabric](https://guitarkitfabric.co.uk/guitar-body-prs-spalted-top-7141269523374-en.html) and it was delivered today.

The body looks very nice (as far as I'm concerned),
but in practice it's very rough and needs sanding,
it will definitely also need varnishing and maybe some subtle dying too.


# What's next ?
I found a nice neck to pair with it,
ordered from a different vendor,
which should arrive tomorrow and which I'll show you once I make sure it's usable.
