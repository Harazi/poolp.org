plakar is a free and opensource utility to create versioned backups with compression, encryption and data deduplication.

It is designed to be dead simple to use, requiring only a few minutes to get familiar with most commands. Creating a backup is as easy as typing plakar push and restoring as easy as typing plakar pull.

plakar is written in Go, developed primarily on macOS and OpenBSD, built and tested on Linux, and it should work on most modern Unix-like system.
