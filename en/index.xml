I have had significant experience in designing, building, delivering and operating multiple business-critical software and services in my career.
My speciality is to audit projects and architectures to spot weaknesses that can result in incidents, and suggest improvements that could not only limit the risks of incidents but make them considerably less stressful.</description></item><item><title>Sponsor me !</title><link>https://poolp.org/en/sponsorship/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><author>gilles@poolp.org (Gilles Chehade)</author><guid>https://poolp.org/en/sponsorship/</guid><description>In February 2019, I switched to a 75% part-time schedule so that I could spend one day each week + one additional day each month working on my own stuff at the cost of slashing a quarter of my wage.
I spend all of these days working on opensource software and writing articles, however I depend on sponsorship from the community to maintain that planning. Without enough sponsors, I need to skip some days and take contracts and sponsored developments to cover my expenses.</description></item></channel></rss>
