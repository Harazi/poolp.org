title: "Hire me !"

I'm a senior **"most-stack"** developer with a strong background in Unix system development and administration,
as well as software and systems architecture.
I have had significant experience in designing,
building,
delivering and operating multiple business-critical software and services in my career.

My speciality is to **audit projects and architectures** to spot weaknesses that can result in incidents,
and suggest improvements that could not only limit the risks of incidents but make them considerably less stressful.
If you're **building an MVP**,
I can assist you in coming up with a proper design,
one that will make use of my experience to avoid mistakes that can turn into huge technical debts.
If you're **already in production**,
I can assist in finding **pragmatic** change paths that will help increase robustness without breaking an existing service.

I can also help with:

* evaluating third-party solutions in your architectures
* setting up good development practices with proper tooling
* leading software developers
* training teams in software and architecture design
* setting up and/or handling system administration of dedicated servers
* fixing bugs or adding features to an existing software
* designing and building an MVP from scratch

You can contract me for very short missions spanning over a few days,
or long-standing missions spanning over a few months,
this is only limited by my pending contracts and schedule.
