The second goal is to set myself a reasonnable objective, by not having to cut and glue wood myself, so that I can see if I like building guitars at all.
The serie will follow this little project, either to completion or to utter failure, whichever comes first :-)</description></item><item><title>A new section appeared !</title><link>https://poolp.org/posts/2023-06-25/a-new-section-appeared/</link><pubDate>Sun, 25 Jun 2023 17:29:00 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://poolp.org/posts/2023-06-25/a-new-section-appeared/</guid><description>TL;DR: I will be discussing music on this blog from now on. This blog is a musical blog too As some of you know, I have a deep interest for music.
This blog section will focus on music-related topics, from a listener, amateur musician and/or producer point of view.
I will sometimes post links to music I want to share, either because I did it, or because I like it, but I will also write articles and share hardware and software reviews.</description></item></channel></rss>
