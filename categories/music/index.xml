This blog is a musical blog too As some of you know, I have a deep interest for music.
This blog section will focus on music-related topics, from a listener, amateur musician and/or producer point of view.
I will sometimes post links to music I want to share, either because I did it, or because I like it, but I will also write articles and share hardware and software reviews.</description></item></channel></rss>
