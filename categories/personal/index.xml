As I closed the door to our home, I told your mom with a huge smile that the next time we&amp;rsquo;d open the door we&amp;rsquo;d no longer be only the two of us. This was the best day of our lives.
In December, we got the news that your mom was pregnant of you.</description></item><item><title>happy new year 2019, a personal post</title><link>https://poolp.org/posts/2019-06-02/happy-new-year-2019-a-personal-post/</link><pubDate>Sun, 02 Jun 2019 13:42:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://poolp.org/posts/2019-06-02/happy-new-year-2019-a-personal-post/</guid><description>TL;DR: Way too many things happened in a six months timeframe. This post won't need a TL;DR as I'll keep it short. Generalized anxiety disorder and alexithymia. Late 2018, I&amp;rsquo;ve been diagnosed with generalized anxiety disorder and alexithymia a couple weeks apart.
The anxiety disorder didn&amp;rsquo;t really come as a surprise as I know very well the traumatic experience that led to the disorder. It&amp;rsquo;ll still take a lot of hours of hypnosis to continue cleaning up trauma after trauma, but taking care of it and releasing some of the traumas has improved considerably my anxiety.</description></item><item><title>News from the front !</title><link>https://poolp.org/posts/2018-01-08/news-from-the-front/</link><pubDate>Mon, 08 Jan 2018 12:11:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://poolp.org/posts/2018-01-08/news-from-the-front/</guid><description>TL;DR: Came very close to a burn out late 2016, had to quit former employer. Started working at another company early 2017. Became a student again, currently halfway through second year in psychology. Haven't done much opensource since early 2017, slowly resuming. Happy new year ! I wish you a very happy new year 2018 and hope that you succeed in whatever you attempt.
It feels odd to write again to this blog considering the last blog post dates from September 2016, over a year ago.</description></item><item><title>Welcome to you, 2013</title><link>https://poolp.org/posts/2013-01-08/welcome-to-you-2013/</link><pubDate>Tue, 08 Jan 2013 23:16:43 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://poolp.org/posts/2013-01-08/welcome-to-you-2013/</guid><description>YO!
I know I should have posted a &amp;ldquo;Happy New Year&amp;rdquo; note earlier but you know how it is: new year eve&amp;rsquo;s aftermath, days to recover, work resumes, mood slacks, bleh.
Anyway, today&amp;rsquo;s note is simply about that: wishing you and me an awesome year 2013 and hoping you will not turn it into a fucking mess. After all, you&amp;rsquo;re in charge so we know who to blame ;-)
As far as I&amp;rsquo;m concerned, year 2012 wasn&amp;rsquo;t &amp;ldquo;great&amp;rdquo;, it was not the absolute suck either, it was even quite decent.</description></item></channel></rss>
