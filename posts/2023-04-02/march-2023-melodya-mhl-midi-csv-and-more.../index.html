Partly because of <a href=/posts/2023-03-01/i-love-you/>life events and grieving</a>,
partly because of general demotivation and partly because the training is draining what&rsquo;s left of my brain.
I&rsquo;m slowly but surely stepping back in the game.</p><h1 id=mhl-midi-to-human-language>MHL: MIDI to human language</h1><p>For a couple of projects,
I needed a way to <strong>express MIDI in a human-readable format</strong>.</p><p>Those who have followed my work on <code>earmuff</code> may assume that it can serve this purpose,
but it doesn&rsquo;t because <strong>it expresses things programatically and at a higher-level</strong>:
where <code>earmuff</code> works with bars and beats and durations,
MIDI works with a set of events triggering at absolute ticks,
where <code>earmuff</code> has repeats blocks to provide &ldquo;loops&rdquo;,
MIDI &mldr; well, actually repeats events sequentially.</p><p>I wrote a tiny compiler called <code>mhl</code> that allows building an SMF,
Standard MIDI File,
from the following input and the other way around to generate MHL output from an SMF:</p><pre tabindex=0><code>track=1 ticks=16080 message=NoteOff channel=0 key=40 velocity=64
track=1 ticks=16080 message=NoteOn channel=0 key=59 velocity=89
track=1 ticks=16080 message=NoteOn channel=0 key=55 velocity=89
track=1 ticks=16080 message=NoteOn channel=0 key=52 velocity=89
track=1 ticks=16320 message=NoteOff channel=0 key=59 velocity=64
track=1 ticks=16320 message=NoteOff channel=0 key=55 velocity=64
track=1 ticks=16320 message=NoteOff channel=0 key=52 velocity=64
</code></pre><p>Awesome idea, right ?
nope, wrong.</p><h1 id=go-midicsv-midicsv-implementation-in-golang>go-midicsv: MIDICSV implementation in Golang</h1><p>It turns out that after I was done writing <code>mhl</code>,
I ran into MIDICSV.</p><p>MIDICSV is a specification to represent MIDI as CSV,
a human-readable comma-separated format.
That&rsquo;s exactly what I wanted,
except that it already existed,
already covered what I wanted,
and there were already reference implementations in Perl and Python.
I did some experimenting with the Python version,
and since it proved to cover my functional needs,
<strong>I decided to toss MHL and switch to using MIDICSV</strong>.</p><p>I could not use the python version itself,
partly because I needed to call it from Golang which was painful,
but also because <code>py_midicsv</code> insists on using files whereas I need to work on bytes&mldr;
so I wrote a Golang implementation for my needs.
This is a work in progress,
do not use for anything serious,
but the initial code is <a href=https://github.com/poolpOrg/go-midicsv>already commited and available in a Github repository</a>.</p><p>Long story short,
the package comes with two commands <code>midi2csv</code> and <code>csv2midi</code>,
both built using the <code>go-midicsv/encoding</code> package which <strong>provides an Encoder and Decoder</strong>.
The Encoder reads bytes from an SMF and converts them into a MIDICSV output,
whereas the Decoder reads a MIDICSV input and converts it into an SMF output.</p><p>The code currently only works for valid SMF files and will likely panic on any invalidly crafted SMF,
I will make it error out nicely in the upcoming weeks.
Good enough for my pocs.</p><h1 id=melodya-a-melody-and-music-assistant>Melodya: a melody and music assistant</h1><p>Melodya is a project I&rsquo;ll be working on and off for the next few months:
it is <strong>a melody and music assistant</strong>,
helping you write, understand and improve music through the help of AI.
Unless you&rsquo;ve been hiding under a rock,
you have probably already seen ChatGPT at work,
it&rsquo;s impressive af,
and it can prove really useful in this use-case of assisting music creation.</p><p>Unfortunately,
it <strong>only understands text so it&rsquo;s hard to have it work with music</strong>:
it can&rsquo;t take sound or sheet music as input.
I had already played with this in December,
<a href=/posts/2022-12-30/december-2022-some-more-earmuff-and-go-harmony/#chatgpt>teaching ChatGPT about <code>earmuff</code></a>
and having it generate new <code>earmuff</code> source based on instructions.
It worked,
it worked insanely well,
but had some shortcomings because <code>earmuff</code> was invented after the cut-off date for its corpus and doesn&rsquo;t come with enough examples.
Unless my prompts were very precise,
it would generate instruments names that aren&rsquo;t recognized,
sometimes even constructs that it thought existed but didn&rsquo;t,
and such&mldr;</p><p>Luckily,
between <code>earmuff</code>, <code>go-harmony</code> and <code>go-midicsv</code>,
I have written enough code that help deal with music programatically and in human-readable formats that I can use <code>ChatGPT</code> reliably enough for my purpose&mldr;
so I played tetris.
I assembled blocks,
and here&rsquo;s the initial result after a few hours of work.
A chatbot that understands what I want to do on a musical project,
that keeps track of the state of my project and that can provide explanations while generating MIDI output:</p><center><img src=melodya.jpg><br><br><img src=melodya2.jpg><br><br></center><p>This was the very first step.</p><p>I would like to implement speech-to-text so I can dictate my needs,
text-to-speech so it can hear back its answers,
but I would also like to <strong>accept input coming from a MIDI device</strong> so I can ask it to analyze, correct me or make suggestions,
just as I&rsquo;d like to allow it to <strong>output to a MIDI device</strong> so I can plug it to a synthesizer or DAW so I can use it more directly.</p><p>In addition,
because <strong>MIDI can be (indirectly) converted to sheet music</strong>,
I&rsquo;d like to be able to display the sheet music as it&rsquo;s being worked on and adapted.</p><h1 id=whats-next->What&rsquo;s next ?</h1><p>April will be essentially spent on my training,
so I don&rsquo;t expect much code to be written.</p><p>If I manage to,
it&rsquo;ll likely be melodya related.</p><p>Stay tuned !</p></div><div class="row PageNavigation d-flex justify-content-between font-weight-bold"><a class="d-block col-md-6 text-lg-right" href=https://poolp.org/posts/2023-03-01/i-love-you/>I love you &#187;</a><div class=clearfix></div></div></div></div></div><div class=container><div id=comments class="row justify-content-center mb-5"><div class=col-md-8><script src=https://giscus.app/client.js data-repo=poolpOrg/poolp.org data-repo-id="MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMjYxODk2MjA=" data-category=Articles data-category-id=DIC_kwDOB4WANM4B-Zf1 data-mapping=og:title data-strict=0 data-reactions-enabled=1 data-emit-metadata=1 data-input-position=top data-theme=light data-lang=en data-loading=lazy crossorigin=anonymous async></script></div></div></div></div><div class=alertbar><div class="container text-center"><span><img src=/images/poolp_org.png alt=logo height=0px>
