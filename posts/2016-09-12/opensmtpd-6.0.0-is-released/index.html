</code></pre><p>Seems like a very productive slacking, however some of these changes turn out
to be very interesting in terms of code simplification and security.</p><p>In this article I&rsquo;ll focus on the fork+(re)exec model change.</p><h2 id=memory-space-randomization>Memory space randomization</h2><p>OpenBSD provides each process with a randomized memory space where pretty much
everything ending up in memory is going to have different locations each time
you run a new instance. All memory allocations using either <code>malloc()</code> or
<code>mmap()</code> are randomized, the dynamic loader is randomized and recent work was
committed so that libc gets randomized at each and every system start, the
goal being that not only the place where the symbols are mapped in memory
changes at every run, but that the symbols themselves get shuffled so that
they are randomized one relative to another.</p><p>This basically means that if we both run the same program, there&rsquo;s about zero
chances that we will have a similar memory layout and that functions will be
sitting at the same addresses.</p><p>In terms of security this makes exploitation particularly hard as there aren&rsquo;t
so many things an attacker can guess regarding the memory layout. She can&rsquo;t
study her own system to determine where things are located on yours, and every
time the instance is restarted, former knowledge has gone away so that anything
learnt will no longer be true once the program restarts.</p><p>This coupled with the fact that OpenBSD daemons tend to exit rather than attempt
to rexecute a crashed process, level up the barrier quite a bit.</p><p>Here, a program will simply print &ldquo;the same&rdquo; addresses every time it is
executed:</p><pre><code> $ ./a.out
 0x7f7ffffd4514  address of a stack variable
 0x1061902ffe40  address of a malloc() allocation
 0x105eeb000a64  address of a function within the program
 0x105eeb000a6a  address of the main function
 0x1060fcf67a90  address of a libc function
 
 $ ./a.out
 0x7f7ffffbb714  address of a stack variable
 0xf7cbac277c0   address of a malloc() allocation
 0xf7a05d00a64   address of a function within the program
 0xf7a05d00a6a   address of the main function

</code></pre><h2 id=the-opensmtpd-bootstrap>The OpenSMTPD bootstrap</h2><p>The idea for fork+exec in OpenSMTPD came from a discussion between <code>deraadt@</code>
and <code>eric@</code> during a hackathon I hosted in Nantes mid-May this year.</p><p>The OpenSMTPD bootstrap process was quite simple:</p><p>Upon executation, the parent process would read configuration, build a memory
representation of it and would then create a bunch of <code>socketpair()</code> before
<code>fork()</code>-ing all of its child processes.</p><p>By the virtue of <code>fork()</code>, all children would inherit the configuration as well
as all the sockets necessary for IPC. They would only have to zero and free the
bits of configuration they don&rsquo;t need and close sockets meant to be used by the
other children and be set.</p><p>This was nice and all, but could be improved.</p><p>When a process <code>fork()</code>s, the child process gets an exact copy of the parent
memory space. Any symbol in the parent address space is present at the same
address in the child and only new allocations will cause the parent and child
to diverge.</p><p>So everytime you run OpenSMTPD, the processes in your instance are different
from the last time you ran it, however within a single instance the processes
share a lot of addresses together. In the following example, note how all of
the symbols share the same address in parent and child, except for the
<code>malloc()</code> call that happened after <code>fork()</code>:</p><pre><code>$ ./a.out
=== in parent
0x7f7ffffd3c44  address of a stack variable
0x8e8a457c040   address of a malloc() allocation BEFORE fork
0x8e8181631c0   address of a malloc() allocation AFTER fork

</code></pre><p>While all the OpenSMTPD processes end up diverging by a great lot when
it comes to locally allocated addresses, the problem is that if a process
is compromised then it gives immediate information regarding all of the
other processes.</p><p>Knowing the memory address of the configuration in a child process will
immediately tell an attacker where the configuration is located in all
of the other processes, and if the proper amount of bugs is found this
can prove useful.</p><h2 id=the-new-forkreexec-model>The new <code>fork()</code>+(re)exec model</h2><p>The exec family function will transform an existing process into a new
process by basically reconstructing it from the new program.</p><p>This is what happens when your shell stops being a shell and becomes
a <code>ls</code> instance for example. It forgets (pretty much) everything it
knew about the former process and starts with its own brand new
randomized memory space.</p><p>So <code>deraadt@</code> suggested that if OpenSMTPD would not just <code>fork()</code> children
but instead <code>fork()</code> them and reexecute the <code>smtpd</code> binary, then each of
the children would have its own randomized memory space.</p><p>The idea itself is neat, however not so trivial to implement because when
we reexec the whole &ldquo;inherit configuration and descriptors&rdquo; part goes away.
It&rsquo;s not just fork and exec, it&rsquo;s fork and exec and figure a way for the
parent to pass back all the information and descriptors back to the new
post-fork instance so it is the new instance that allocates memory and
decides where the information goes.</p><pre><code>$ ./a.out

</code></pre><p>Eric reworked the entire bootstrap process so the parent reads configuration,
creates all of the sockets, forks & execs all children in a special mode&mldr;</p><p>&mldr; then have the parent pass each children only the bit of configuration
they need and the descriptors they require for IPC.</p><p>This was really hard work and I&rsquo;m amazed he managed to wrap it between the
hackathon and the release freeze, this makes OpenSMTPD far more resistant to
a whole lot new range of attacks.</p><p>I&rsquo;ll write about the smtp engine improvements in a further article, stay tuned.</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=https%3a%2f%2fpoolp.org%2fposts%2f2016-09-12%2fopensmtpd-6.0.0-is-released%2f&text=OpenSMTPD%206.0.0%20is%20released%20%21&via=poolpOrg" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=https%3a%2f%2fpoolp.org%2fposts%2f2016-09-12%2fopensmtpd-6.0.0-is-released%2f" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=https%3a%2f%2fpoolp.org%2fposts%2f2016-09-12%2fopensmtpd-6.0.0-is-released%2f&title=OpenSMTPD%206.0.0%20is%20released%20%21" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=https%3a%2f%2fpoolp.org%2fposts%2f2016-09-12%2fopensmtpd-6.0.0-is-released%2f&title=OpenSMTPD%206.0.0%20is%20released%20%21" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=https%3a%2f%2fpoolp.org%2fposts%2f2016-09-12%2fopensmtpd-6.0.0-is-released%2f&title=OpenSMTPD%206.0.0%20is%20released%20%21" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=https%3a%2f%2fpoolp.org%2fposts%2f2016-09-12%2fopensmtpd-6.0.0-is-released%2f&description=OpenSMTPD%206.0.0%20is%20released%20%21" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=https://poolp.org/posts/2015-12-22/home-sweet-home/ data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Home, sweet home">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=https://poolp.org/posts/2018-01-08/news-from-the-front/ data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="News from the front !">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer style=text-align:justify><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><h2>Like my work and want to help me ?</h2><br><ul><li>Consider <b>tipping me</b> on <b><a target=_blank href=https://paypal.me/poolpOrg>PayPal</a></b>,
