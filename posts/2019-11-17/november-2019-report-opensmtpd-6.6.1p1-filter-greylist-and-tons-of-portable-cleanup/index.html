This post won't need a TL;DR as I'll keep it short. Generalized anxiety disorder and alexithymia. Late 2018, I&rsquo;ve been diagnosed with generalized anxiety disorder and alexithymia a couple weeks apart.
The anxiety disorder didn&rsquo;t really come as a surprise as I know very well the traumatic experience that led to the disorder. It&rsquo;ll still take a lot of hours of hypnosis to continue cleaning up trauma after trauma, but taking care of it and releasing some of the traumas has improved considerably my anxiety.</div></a><a class="article block px-3 py-4 hover:bg-slate-200 dark:hover:bg-slate-700" href=/posts/2018-12-21/opensmtpd-now-supports-regex-in-match-rules/><h3 class="text-lg font-semibold mb-0.5">OpenSMTPD now supports regex in match rules</h3><div class="text-sm text-slate-500 dark:text-slate-400 line-clamp-2">TL;DR: regex table lookups were introduced for builtin filters. After a few weeks of working solely on filters, I wanted to work on something else. Using the same mechanism, all match criterias using tables can support regex. K_REGEX lookups The table mechanism is used within OpenSMTPD to perform all kinds of lookups.
Recently, while working on builtin filters, I introduced the K_REGEX lookup type allowing tables to serve regex(3) patterns.</div></a><a class="article block px-3 py-4 hover:bg-slate-200 dark:hover:bg-slate-700" href=/posts/2018-12-19/more-on-opensmtpd-filters/><h3 class="text-lg font-semibold mb-0.5">more on OpenSMTPD filters</h3><div class="text-sm text-slate-500 dark:text-slate-400 line-clamp-2">TL;DR: Not this time, pal/gal, I took hours writing this post, you'll take a few minutes reading it all. Oh, and merry X-mas :-* A bit of short-sighted history The filtering feature has been introduced only recently in OpenSMTPD, first presented on this blog a month ago.
I had a working proof-of-concept running on my laptop and my plan was to start bringing the code to the OpenBSD tree, small chunks by small chunks, through a serie of diffs.</div></a><a class="article block px-3 py-4 hover:bg-slate-200 dark:hover:bg-slate-700" href=/posts/2018-12-06/opensmtpd-proc-filters-fc-rdns/><h3 class="text-lg font-semibold mb-0.5">OpenSMTPD proc filters & fc-rDNS</h3><div class="text-sm text-slate-500 dark:text-slate-400 line-clamp-2">TL;DR: I *FINALFUCKINGLY* commited proc filters support allowing full filtering in OpenSMTPD. eric@ implemented fc-rDNS lookups. fc-rDNS fc-rDNS, or forward-confirmed reverse DNS, consists in performing a reverse DNS lookup to determine the hostname associated to an IP address&mldr; then performing a DNS lookup on that hostname to check if it resolves back to the IP address.
On my request, eric@ implemented fc-rDNS lookups in our SMTP engine, causing OpenSMTPD to perform the double lookup upon clients connections.</div></a><a class="article block px-3 py-4 hover:bg-slate-200 dark:hover:bg-slate-700" href=/posts/2018-11-09/opensmtpd-reporting-update/><h3 class="text-lg font-semibold mb-0.5">OpenSMTPD reporting update</h3><div class="text-sm text-slate-500 dark:text-slate-400 line-clamp-2">TL;DR: The reporting mechanism has been described shortly in my previous article about both reporting and filters. Let's focus a bit more on the reporting bits this time. The format is improving further and has extended to outgoing trafic reporting. Reporting In previous article, I described the events reporting mechanism that has been introduced in the development branch of OpenSMTPD.
To sum it up, you could now write an event processor as simple as a shell script reading its stdin on a loop:</div></a><a class="article block px-3 py-4 hover:bg-slate-200 dark:hover:bg-slate-700" href=/posts/2018-11-03/opensmtpd-released-and-upcoming-filters-preview/><h3 class="text-lg font-semibold mb-0.5">OpenSMTPD released and upcoming filters preview</h3><div class="text-sm text-slate-500 dark:text-slate-400 line-clamp-2">TL;DR: Filters have been a (the most ?) long awaited feature in OpenSMTPD. I finally committed most of the filters code to OpenBSD. There is still a bit of work required but the trickiest parts are done. This article describes how filters are implemented and what to expect. OpenSMTPD 6.4.0 was released ! We have released OpenSMTPD 6.4.0 last week without filters.
I won&rsquo;t expand on the features in the 6.</div></a><a class="article block px-3 py-4 hover:bg-slate-200 dark:hover:bg-slate-700" href=/posts/2018-05-21/switching-to-opensmtpd-new-config/><h3 class="text-lg font-semibold mb-0.5">switching to OpenSMTPD new config</h3><div class="text-sm text-slate-500 dark:text-slate-400 line-clamp-2">TL;DR: Switching to new config is not too hard and can be done in minutes. The new config is also a new queue that is not backwards compatible. The easiest way is to flush the mail queue before switching. We came up with a solution to help maintainers of more complex setups. Switching from old config to new config The new OpenSMTPD configuration grammar is slightly different from the current one, rules are no longer stated as single lines, but the conversion from previous ruleset to new ruleset isn&rsquo;t that hard.</div></a><a class="article block px-3 py-4 hover:bg-slate-200 dark:hover:bg-slate-700" href=/posts/2018-04-30/opensmtpd-new-config/><h3 class="text-lg font-semibold mb-0.5">OpenSMTPD new config</h3><div class="text-sm text-slate-500 dark:text-slate-400 line-clamp-2">TL;DR: OpenBSD #p2k18 hackathon took place at Epitech in Nantes. I was organizing the hackathon but managed to make progress on OpenSMTPD. As mentionned at EuroBSDCon the one-line per rule config format was a design error. A new configuration grammar is almost ready and the underlying structures are simplified. Refactor removes ~750 lines of code and solves _many_ issues that were side-effects of the design error. New features are going to be unlocked thanks to this.</div></a><a class="article block px-3 py-4 hover:bg-slate-200 dark:hover:bg-slate-700" href=/posts/2018-01-29/install-openbsd-on-dedibox-with-full-disk-encryption/><h3 class="text-lg font-semibold mb-0.5">Install OpenBSD on dedibox with full-disk encryption</h3><div class="text-sm text-slate-500 dark:text-slate-400 line-clamp-2">TL;DR: I run several "dedibox" servers at online.net, all powered by OpenBSD.

Aaron Poffenberger wrote a shell-based `spf_fetch` utility. I wrote a C-based `spfwalk` utility that's `pledge()`-ed. The `spfwalk` utility got merged to `smtpctl`. What&rsquo;s SPF in a few words SPF is the Sender Policy Framework, a standard to verify the domain name of an e-mail sender.
Long story short, the SMTP protocol does not come with a way to authenticate a domain and, during an SMTP session, nothing really prevents a sender from pretending to come from any domain:</div></a><a class="article block px-3 py-4 hover:bg-slate-200 dark:hover:bg-slate-700" href=/posts/2018-01-08/news-from-the-front/><h3 class="text-lg font-semibold mb-0.5">News from the front !</h3><div class="text-sm text-slate-500 dark:text-slate-400 line-clamp-2">TL;DR: Came very close to a burn out late 2016, had to quit former employer.

Turns out most of the changes are not visible. A featureless release I managed to wrap the 6.0.0 release yesterday.
Unlike most of our releases, it comes out with almost no new feature.
The changelog fits in less than 10 lines as follows:
- new fork+reexec model so each process has its own randomized memory space - logging format has been reworked - a "multi-line response" bug in the LMTP delivery backend has been fixed - connections concurrency limits have been bumped - artificial delaying in remote sessions have been reduced - dhparams option has been removed - dhe option has been added, supporting auto and legacy modes - smtp engine has been simplified - various cosmethic changes, code cleanup and documentation improvement Seems like a very productive slacking, however some of these changes turn out to be very interesting in terms of code simplification and security.</div></a><a class="article block px-3 py-4 hover:bg-slate-200 dark:hover:bg-slate-700" href=/posts/2015-12-22/home-sweet-home/><h3 class="text-lg font-semibold mb-0.5">Home, sweet home</h3><div class="text-sm text-slate-500 dark:text-slate-400 line-clamp-2">TL;DR: OpenSMTPD on github no longer diverges from OpenBSD. Since last episode Sometime this year, we released OpenSMTPD 5.7.1 which was the first version that shipped with the long-awaited experimental filters support. The result of over a year and a half of very very deep refactor in our IO layer and the addition of a very elegant but also very tricky new API.
This refactor took place outside the OpenBSD tree because it required breaking a lot of code for extended period of times, which spanned over 3 OpenBSD releases.</div></a><a class="article block px-3 py-4 hover:bg-slate-200 dark:hover:bg-slate-700" href=/posts/2014-12-12/the-state-of-filters/><h3 class="text-lg font-semibold mb-0.5">The state of filters</h3><div class="text-sm text-slate-500 dark:text-slate-400 line-clamp-2">TL;DR: yeeeees, filters are coming. don't believe us ? here's an example. be patient. On my death bed On my death bed, when my life flashes before my eyes and I start recalling what people have told me during my (hopefully long) lifetime, these sentences will single out:
&ldquo;When will OpenSMTPD support filters ? I need it.&rdquo;
Not that it carries a philosophical meaning that will have taken me a lifetime of thinking, but because for the last three years I have been hearing this every time I met someone IRL and discussed OpenSMTPD, I have read it on our Github issues tracker, on GTalk, on IRC, on Twitter, on Facebook, on random forums, and just this week three times in my mailbox.</div></a><a class="article block px-3 py-4 hover:bg-slate-200 dark:hover:bg-slate-700" href=/posts/2014-12-10/some-opensmtpd-overview-part-3/><h3 class="text-lg font-semibold mb-0.5">Some OpenSMTPD overview, part 3</h3><div class="text-sm text-slate-500 dark:text-slate-400 line-clamp-2">EHLO,
This is the third post of a series about OpenSMTPD improvements that have taken place since this summer.
Content altering For a long time, we have developed OpenSMTPD with a strict rule that the daemon should not alter DATA (as in the DATA SMTP phase) in any way.
The rationale was that by enforcing that rule, the message writing was simplified as the smtp process would simply read data from a client and write it, without any post-processing, to a file descriptor.</div></a><a class="article block px-3 py-4 hover:bg-slate-200 dark:hover:bg-slate-700" href=/posts/2014-12-01/some-opensmtpd-overview-part-2/><h3 class="text-lg font-semibold mb-0.5">Some OpenSMTPD overview, part 2</h3><div class="text-sm text-slate-500 dark:text-slate-400 line-clamp-2">Why we killed the MFA (filter) process For as long as I can remember, a process called MFA was created by OpenSMTPD at start time.
MFA stood for &ldquo;Mail Filter Agent&rdquo; and the goal of that process was initially to take care of all filtering tasks ranging from filtering senders based on the ruleset matching to starting and controlling filters.
As time passed by, we figured the lookup process was better suited for ruleset matching and the MFA process became mostly idle, we renamed it to &ldquo;filter&rdquo; process since the only thing it had to do was take care of starting filters and making sure they had the proper environment.</div></a><a class="article block px-3 py-4 hover:bg-slate-200 dark:hover:bg-slate-700" href=/posts/2014-11-26/some-opensmtpd-overview-part-1/><h3 class="text-lg font-semibold mb-0.5">Some OpenSMTPD overview, part 1</h3><div class="text-sm text-slate-500 dark:text-slate-400 line-clamp-2">EHLO world ! Yesterday I thought I&rsquo;d write a first OpenSMTPD-related post to sum up the changes that have happened since this summer but it turned out to be painful as they amount to quite a lot. Instead, I think a better strategy is to split this into a serie of smaller posts focused on the specific changes ;-)
So, in June I have organized a mini hackathon at my brand new place and invited some of the French Connection at home.</div></a><a class="article block px-3 py-4 hover:bg-slate-200 dark:hover:bg-slate-700" href=/posts/2014-11-24/what-the-fsck-did-just-happen/><h3 class="text-lg font-semibold mb-0.5">what the fsck did just happen</h3><div class="text-sm text-slate-500 dark:text-slate-400 line-clamp-2">Good news everyone !
With last post dating from almost a year, we can all agree that I&rsquo;ve outpassed my slacking skills by a great margin and I probably deserve an award of some kind ;-)
Anyways, there&rsquo;s been a few complaints during these 12 months because this blog was the main source of information for the OpenSMTPD project and several posts which used to describe features and configuration samples had suddenly disappeared.</div></a><a class="article block px-3 py-4 hover:bg-slate-200 dark:hover:bg-slate-700" href=/posts/2013-12-14/news-from-the-front/><h3 class="text-lg font-semibold mb-0.5">News-from-the-front</h3><div class="text-sm text-slate-500 dark:text-slate-400 line-clamp-2">EHLO readers,

I have not updated this blog since the release of OpenSMTPD 5.3, over a month ago. In the meantime, some minor bugs have been fixed and we have released OpenSMTPD 5.3.1.
The main reason for the silence is that I was busy with completely unrelated day-time work, unrelated opensource code, the OpenSMTPD book in progress and some minor health issues that have caused endless side-effects keeping my mind away from this blog.</div></a><a class="article block px-3 py-4 hover:bg-slate-200 dark:hover:bg-slate-700" href=/posts/2013-03-17/opensmtpd-5.3-released/><h3 class="text-lg font-semibold mb-0.5">OpenSMTPD 5.3 released</h3><div class="text-sm text-slate-500 dark:text-slate-400 line-clamp-2">OHAI !

We had planned to slow down a bit to prepare for release: no more feature, no more invasive changes until we tag something out of which we can publish a release. I then discussed with Bret Lambert (blambert@) and he asked me if we used some kind of code scanner to detect defects in our code.
We do use the clang static analyzer every now and then, the last time being a couple week ago, and we spend a few minutes cleaning up the defects we believe to be real issues.</div></a><a class="article block px-3 py-4 hover:bg-slate-200 dark:hover:bg-slate-700" href=/posts/2013-01-25/opensmtpd-gentlemen-fasten-your-seatbelt/><h3 class="text-lg font-semibold mb-0.5">OpenSMTPD: gentlemen, fasten your seatbelt</h3><div class="text-sm text-slate-500 dark:text-slate-400 line-clamp-2">OHAI,
Lately we have stabilized and decided that we&rsquo;re okay with the features we have for our first release, this time for good, so we focused on making sure that we didn&rsquo;t introduce regressions and that we were rock solid.
We stressed incoming and outgoing path and found areas of improvements. This will be a long-standing task, but we have already improved memory usage considerably under high-load, we&rsquo;re pretty happy with the result.</div></a><a class="article block px-3 py-4 hover:bg-slate-200 dark:hover:bg-slate-700" href=/posts/2013-01-18/opensmtpd-stress-and-features/><h3 class="text-lg font-semibold mb-0.5">OpenSMTPD: stress and features</h3><div class="text-sm text-slate-500 dark:text-slate-400 line-clamp-2">&lt;p>Hey,&lt;/p> I wanted to publish something last Friday but I unfortunately got my hands on a copy of Super Nintendo's Zelda which led to an instant loss of motivation.
Here's a quick summary of what happened recently in OpenSMTPD-land, it's not an exhaustive description and to be honest I'm keeping a lot of information private at this point and probably until release ;-)
A snapshot should be published tomorrow.

I know I should have posted a &ldquo;Happy New Year&rdquo; note earlier but you know how it is: new year eve&rsquo;s aftermath, days to recover, work resumes, mood slacks, bleh.
Anyway, today&rsquo;s note is simply about that: wishing you and me an awesome year 2013 and hoping you will not turn it into a fucking mess. After all, you&rsquo;re in charge so we know who to blame ;-)
As far as I&rsquo;m concerned, year 2012 wasn&rsquo;t &ldquo;great&rdquo;, it was not the absolute suck either, it was even quite decent.</div></a><a class="article block px-3 py-4 hover:bg-slate-200 dark:hover:bg-slate-700" href=/posts/2012-12-28/opensmtpd-ssl-relay-stuff/><h3 class="text-lg font-semibold mb-0.5">OpenSMTPD: SSL & relay stuff</h3><div class="text-sm text-slate-500 dark:text-slate-400 line-clamp-2">OHAI,
I was unable to write a story last week as my desk broke into pieces for no apparent reason but my foot hitting it accidentally.
I still don&rsquo;t have a desk so I will make this short by not telling about the queue profiling and SQL log conversion I wrote, and not even writing about the filter work done by Eric, he&rsquo;ll write about it if he wants to or I&rsquo;ll do that next time.</div></a><a class="article block px-3 py-4 hover:bg-slate-200 dark:hover:bg-slate-700" href=/posts/2012-12-14/opensmtpd-ldap-support-selectable-source-dkim-and-goodies/><h3 class="text-lg font-semibold mb-0.5">OpenSMTPD: LDAP support, selectable source, DKIM and Goodies</h3><div class="text-sm text-slate-500 dark:text-slate-400 line-clamp-2">&lt;p>OHAI,&lt;/p> This week has been crazy, my brain melted a little as I worked on filters, it melted a little as I worked on LDAP and it melted a little more as I tried to trick Eric into working on filters with me (yes, that actually worked :-).

This week I had intended to work on filters. After 3 days of pain and swearing, even though it did move forward, I finally decided to step back for a few days and work on something else to preserve my sanity.
As you may have guessed, this week has not been too productive&mldr; Oh wait, yes it has ! It&rsquo;s actually been incredibly productive :-)
Just as usual, I will only write a summary for this week, the complete changelog can be retrieved from our mirror on Github.</div></a><a class="article block px-3 py-4 hover:bg-slate-200 dark:hover:bg-slate-700" href=/posts/2012-11-30/opensmtpd-more-features-more-cleanup-more-more/><h3 class="text-lg font-semibold mb-0.5">OpenSMTPD: more features, more cleanup, more more</h3><div class="text-sm text-slate-500 dark:text-slate-400 line-clamp-2">OHAI,
First of all, on a completely unrelated note, I&rsquo;d like to emphasize that this blog post is being written from my text editor launched by a little shell and pushed to poolp using the Ocean API. I can be web2.0 from console and emacs, and that&rsquo;s definitely worth a mention ;-)
As has become a habit, a lot of work has been poured in OpenSMTPD this week, here is an incomplete summary of the most notable changes.</div></a><a class="article block px-3 py-4 hover:bg-slate-200 dark:hover:bg-slate-700" href=/posts/2012-11-17/news-from-the-front/><h3 class="text-lg font-semibold mb-0.5">News from the front</h3><div class="text-sm text-slate-500 dark:text-slate-400 line-clamp-2">Almost a month since my last post&mldr; I know, I know.
So I left my position at Scality two weeks ago. I had been there for a year and a half working on a very interesting and tricky project. I will miss my colleagues and the discussions we had on all kinds of topic, I hope them the best future and that we will be able to share beers again ;-)</div></a><a class="article block px-3 py-4 hover:bg-slate-200 dark:hover:bg-slate-700" href=/posts/2012-08-31/opensmtpd-crypto/compress-fixes-and-import-initial-stab-at-ldap/><h3 class="text-lg font-semibold mb-0.5">OpenSMTPD: crypto/compress fixes and import initial stab at LDAP</h3><div class="text-sm text-slate-500 dark:text-slate-400 line-clamp-2">The crypto backend that has been committed a couple days ago started a little discussion and it was decided to switch the default cipher from Blowfish to AES-128 and make it a default.
Encryption can now be enabled as simply as:
queue encryption key &ldquo;foobar&rdquo;
That being said, Charles cleaned up a bit the compression code to make it use FILE* instead of file descriptors. This allows us to ensure we don&rsquo;t have to deal with any buffering and interruption handling code.</div></a><a class="article block px-3 py-4 hover:bg-slate-200 dark:hover:bg-slate-700" href=/posts/2012-08-29/opensmtpd-crypto_backend-and-encrypted-queue/><h3 class="text-lg font-semibold mb-0.5">OpenSMTPD: crypto_backend and encrypted queue</h3><div class="text-sm text-slate-500 dark:text-slate-400 line-clamp-2">A few days ago, Charles committed the compress_backend API which allowed transparent deflation/inflation of envelopes and messages as they hit the queue.
The compression code is executed before the queue_backend gets the data so that any queue_backend can benefit transparently from compression without having to add any code to handle it. Due to our design, this also means that if the queue_backend stores envelopes and messages remotely, then the compression will take place before sending and after fetching, the remote end only ever sees compressed data.</div></a><a class="article block px-3 py-4 hover:bg-slate-200 dark:hover:bg-slate-700" href=/posts/2012-08-26/opensmtpd-i-have-no-idea-for-that-title-sorry/><h3 class="text-lg font-semibold mb-0.5">OpenSMTPD: I have no idea for that title, sorry</h3><div class="text-sm text-slate-500 dark:text-slate-400 line-clamp-2">Howdie,
Eric and I had planned a loooooong time ago to have a hackathon this week-end. However, some asshole piece of shit ran into my car while it was parked, made it unable to take the road and flee without leaving a note. Long story made short, I had to be at the repair shop this week-end to be able to get my car before end of September.
We did get our hackathon though and while it was probably much less productive than if we had met in the same room, it was still very very interesting with tons of improvements and many great features written :-p</div></a><a class="article block px-3 py-4 hover:bg-slate-200 dark:hover:bg-slate-700" href=/posts/2012-08-21/opensmtpd-plenty-of-news/><h3 class="text-lg font-semibold mb-0.5">OpenSMTPD: plenty of news</h3><div class="text-sm text-slate-500 dark:text-slate-400 line-clamp-2">It&rsquo;s been over a month since my last post but I have an excuse: I was super busy, then I was super on vacation &mldr; but I&rsquo;m back again ;-)
So my life was pretty intense these last few weeks, both professionnally and on the opensource front. I&rsquo;ll explain later, for now let&rsquo;s just focus on the OpenSMTPD goodies.
OpenSMTPD portable to a new system First of all, I&rsquo;d like to stress out that Rune Lynge and Charles Longeau did an amazing job at porting OpenSMTPD to yet another system &mldr; MacOSX.</div></a><a class="article block px-3 py-4 hover:bg-slate-200 dark:hover:bg-slate-700" href=/posts/2012-07-15/g2k12-openbsd-hackathon-part-ii/><h3 class="text-lg font-semibold mb-0.5">g2k12: OpenBSD hackathon - part II</h3><div class="text-sm text-slate-500 dark:text-slate-400 line-clamp-2">Yesterday, I came back from Budapest and was too tired to write anything, but here&rsquo;s a quick summary of all the features that have been implemented with regard to OpenSMTPD by Eric, Charles and I.
First of all, Eric [eric@] has moved ASR, his asynchronous resolver, to OpenBSD&rsquo;s libc. This is a huge step forward that will allow OpenSMTPD to contain less code, while providing a better coverage of the resolver code.</div></a><a class="article block px-3 py-4 hover:bg-slate-200 dark:hover:bg-slate-700" href=/posts/2012-07-09/g2k12-openbsd-hackathon/><h3 class="text-lg font-semibold mb-0.5">g2k12: OpenBSD hackathon</h3><div class="text-sm text-slate-500 dark:text-slate-400 line-clamp-2">Yesterday, after nearly missing my plane by 5 minutes, I finally managed to make it to Budapest for g2k12, the OpenBSD general hackathon.
While this is not my first hackathon, this is the first general one with many hackers working on all kinds of subsystems ranging from ports to network and kernel. It&rsquo;s fun to see many people focused on improving different areas which you use daily, sometimes without even noticing, and doing it with as much fun as you are having fixing your own area ;-)</div></a><a class="article block px-3 py-4 hover:bg-slate-200 dark:hover:bg-slate-700" href=/posts/2012-06-19/opensmtpd-development-bug-tracker-github/><h3 class="text-lg font-semibold mb-0.5">OpenSMTPD: development, bug tracker & GitHub</h3><div class="text-sm text-slate-500 dark:text-slate-400 line-clamp-2">It&rsquo;s been a while since my last post about OpenSMTPD.
I don&rsquo;t know what Eric and Charles have been up to, I was quite busy with my daytime job and couldn&rsquo;t really spend much time on the hobby ;-)
Anyways, one of the most requested feature of OpenSMTPD is to provide users with a mean to report bugs and let them contribute more easily. It&rsquo;s been requested two times this week, it&rsquo;s been requested countless times in the last few weeks and months, and as a matter of fact it&rsquo;s also been a nuisance for us as until now we&rsquo;ve kept track of bugs and feature requests in my mailbox.</div></a><a class="article block px-3 py-4 hover:bg-slate-200 dark:hover:bg-slate-700" href=/posts/2012-06-06/opensmtpd-rest-queue/><h3 class="text-lg font-semibold mb-0.5">OpenSMTPD REST queue</h3><div class="text-sm text-slate-500 dark:text-slate-400 line-clamp-2">This is the first post of a series to illustrate and describe a &ldquo;proof of concept&rdquo; code by Charles, Eric and I. I will describe the features as they are implemented.
Since mid-November 2011, OpenSMTPD offers support for an extensible queue API. The queue_backend API allows a developer to write a custom storage driver by implementing a small set of functions that take care of storing, updating and removing envelopes and messages.</div></a><a class="article block px-3 py-4 hover:bg-slate-200 dark:hover:bg-slate-700" href=/posts/2012-05-17/opensmtpd-src-address-maps-and-spamhaus/><h3 class="text-lg font-semibold mb-0.5">OpenSMTPD: src-address maps and spamhaus</h3><div class="text-sm text-slate-500 dark:text-slate-400 line-clamp-2">First of all, I&rsquo;d like to &ldquo;thank&rdquo; The Spamhaus project which forced me into hacking this feature in a hurry.
See, I rent a server at online.net which I use for OpenSMTPD live testing and to run some experimental code before it hits the OpenBSD tree.
Yesterday I received a mail from a user complaining that he couldn&rsquo;t send mail to a friend because we were listed on spamhaus. That was very strange because ALL users at poolp.</div></a><a class="article block px-3 py-4 hover:bg-slate-200 dark:hover:bg-slate-700" href=/posts/2012-05-14/opensmtpd-relay-maps-new-url-syntax/><h3 class="text-lg font-semibold mb-0.5">OpenSMTPD relay maps & new url syntax</h3><div class="text-sm text-slate-500 dark:text-slate-400 line-clamp-2">When we first started working on OpenSMTPD, we planned for future features but we did not necessarily start integrating them right away as the goal was to bootstrap the project first with basic features.
Amongst these features was the ability to use mappings for outgoing MX servers. Currently, OpenSMTPD knows two ways of going out:
Using the DNS system to find MX records: accept for [&mldr;] relay
Using the provided mail exchanger: accept for [&mldr;] relay via &ldquo;my-mx.</div></a><a class="article block px-3 py-4 hover:bg-slate-200 dark:hover:bg-slate-700" href=/posts/2012-05-13/opensmtpd-map_compare-and-k_netaddr/><h3 class="text-lg font-semibold mb-0.5">OpenSMTPD, map_compare() and K_NETADDR</h3><div class="text-sm text-slate-500 dark:text-slate-400 line-clamp-2">Ok, I already posted about the new SQLite map_backend earlier today but it turns out that I&rsquo;ve been very productive, and it was worth another post ;-)
So I decided to start improving our maps support and make them usable from places where they weren&rsquo;t.
primary domains
OpenSMTPD supports two kinds of domains: primary domains and virtual domains. The primary domains do not require providing a list of recipients as it will use system accounts; whereas virtual domains require a list of recipients and/or a fallback address to be provided within a map.</div></a><a class="article block px-3 py-4 hover:bg-slate-200 dark:hover:bg-slate-700" href=/posts/2012-05-12/opensmtpd-meets-sqlite/><h3 class="text-lg font-semibold mb-0.5">OpenSMTPD meets SQLite</h3><div class="text-sm text-slate-500 dark:text-slate-400 line-clamp-2">During the r2k12 hackathon in Paris, Marc Espie committed SQLite to OpenBSD&rsquo;s base system.
This has the side effect that OpenSMTPD can start using it and while we agreed that we did not want it as a strong dependency, the various backends API allow us to make it a soft dependency that can be removed without breaking the daemon if someone really does not want SQLite linked.
Today I decided to give it a try and implement a SQLite backend to the map API.</div></a><a class="article block px-3 py-4 hover:bg-slate-200 dark:hover:bg-slate-700" href=/posts/2012-05-09/some-opensmtpd-news/><h3 class="text-lg font-semibold mb-0.5">Some OpenSMTPD news</h3><div class="text-sm text-slate-500 dark:text-slate-400 line-clamp-2">It&rsquo;s been a whiiiiiiile since my last OpenSMTPD related post. Time to break the slacking, blog-wise.
Unlike what would appear from the outside, there&rsquo;s been a lot of activity, discussions and planning, I&rsquo;ll address some here and will discuss it further soon.
First of all, chl@ has committed to a private branch a major improvement to the filter API: async DNS lookups. Due to the design of OpenSMTPD, it is not acceptable for a filter to perform a blocking call as it will prevent it from processing other sessions.</div></a><a class="article block px-3 py-4 hover:bg-slate-200 dark:hover:bg-slate-700" href=/posts/2005-05-21/fatigue-et-envie-de-vacances.../><h3 class="text-lg font-semibold mb-0.5">fatigue et envie de vacances...</h3><div class="text-sm text-slate-500 dark:text-slate-400 line-clamp-2">Je sais pas pourquoi, mais je suis epuise alors que j&rsquo;ai dormi pres de 14h cette nuit.

this one is not going to be comfortable enough,
but it&rsquo;s really a nice to have.</p><p>I bricked it on the first day,
it took me a while to get it back in shape,
but several issues I mentionned in this article were fixed on that machine !</p><h2 id=better-ci>Better CI</h2><p><a href=https://github.com/ngortheone target=_blank rel=noopener>Ihor Antonov</a> did a very neat job at improving CI infrastructure for the project.</p><p>Until his contributions,
we would only have Ubuntu+glibc in our CI so whenever someone reported a build breakage on another system or distro,
I would spin a VPS somewhere to install the same system and attempt a build there.</p><p>This was less than ideal because sometimes by fixing the build on a target,
I could break another,
and I would spend an afternoon spinning VPS with different systems until everything was back to normal on all.</p><p>He currently set up Arch, Alpine and Ubuntu, which provides us with a nice combination of glibc, musl libc, OpenSSL and LibreSSL build targets,
and helps spot build breakages right away.
This made some of the work I&rsquo;ll describe below <strong>considerably</strong> less painful.</p><p>It greatly improved our support for other systems.</p><h2 id=opensmtpd-661p1-released-and-portable-development-branch-work>OpenSMTPD 6.6.1p1 released and portable development branch work</h2><p>The 6.6.0p1 version was released in October and,
since it became easier to install for several distributions,
it also led more users to test it and report issues on their distributions.</p><p>For most people it worked fine,
but on some systems the build was broken and on others the daemon would blow up at runtime.
Given where it blew,
it was pretty obvious that the issues were really related to the compatibility layer for the most part.
Still, it uncovered many interesting topics.</p><p>They were all fixed and a new version, 6.6.1p1, was released so people would have a working OpenSMTPD on all distributions,
then I proceeded to work on improving the compat layer so similar issues don&rsquo;t come back and haunt us in the future.</p><p>Below are explained the top issues I worked on for 6.6.1p1 and after.</p><h2 id=arc4random>arc4random()</h2><p>On OpenBSD,
<code>arc4random()</code> provides high quality randomness which OpenSMTPD relies heavily upon for pretty much everything.
The implementation provides a stream cipher output which is sliced between consumers,
with the help of the kernel and userland,
so that consumers cannot backtrack or predict the stream.
There&rsquo;s an <a href=https://www.openbsd.org/papers/hackfest2014-arc4random/index.html target=_blank rel=noopener>excellent talk by deraadt@</a> which explains how this works.</p><p>In the portable release of OpenSMTPD,
we attempt to detect if <code>arc4random()</code> is available on the base system and provide a replacement implementation if not.
The replacement is a reliable stream cipher,
so it is not some low-grade best-effort hack,
however we still assume a system <code>arc4random()</code> to be stronger and preferable if only because it could provide system-wide slicing.</p><p>In addition,
OpenSMTPD prefers LibreSSL but can also link against OpenSSL.
The former provides an <code>arc4random()</code> implementation if one is not available on the system,
the latter doesn&rsquo;t.
So depending on the combination of system and TLS library,
we may not have <code>arc4random()</code> at all,
we may have it from the TLS library,
we may have it from the system or we may have it from both.
And we always want to use the best version available,
assuming LibreSSL&rsquo;s version to be preferable over ours (even if it really is the same).</p><p>The compat layer was not too good at catching these cases and it was also not too good at ONLY enabling bits of compat layer.
In some situations where it would not export our own version of <code>arc4random()</code>,
it would still export some internal symbols that led to an assortment of build time and runtime failures.</p><p>The whole <code>arc4random()</code> detection was reworked and works nicely now.</p><h2 id=ipv6-broken-on-some-systems>IPv6 broken on some systems</h2><p>During the 6.5 -> 6.6 development cycle,
I realized that our way to represent IPv6 address in textual format was wrong and reworked it.
This was not a big rework,
the diff was fairly small,
and I merged it to the portable branch.
CI didn&rsquo;t complain and my initial testing didn&rsquo;t show problems because it perfectly dodged the problematic code path (more on that shortly).</p><p>There are some systems <em>**cough cough** using glibc **cough cough**</em> that provide a broken <code>inet_net_pton()</code> function,
supporting only IPv4 and returning EAFNOTSUPPORT when passed an IPv6 address.
I first spotted this in 2013 and made a <code>temp_inet_net_pton()</code> function which would be used temporarily as a fallback if <code>inet_net_pton()</code> failed,
then renamed it to <code>broken_inet_net_pton_ipv6()</code> in 2016 when it became clear that this would never be fixed in glibc.</p><p>The OpenBSD code doesn&rsquo;t have this fallback code,
so when the merge was applied to the portable branch,
it didn&rsquo;t take into account that portable version needed a parameter change for <code>broken_inet_net_pton_ipv6()</code>.
On systems with a working <code>inet_net_pton()</code> the code would be bypassed,
so this issue was not visible,
but on other systems <em>**cough cough** using glibc **cough cough**</em> it would lead to the function failing and broken IPv6 support.</p><p>Fix was applied and IPv6 worked again on systmes with a broken <code>inet_net_pton()</code>.</p><h2 id=alpine-linux-issues-musl-libc-really>Alpine Linux issues (musl libc really)</h2><p>There were reports of crashes from an Alpine Linux user.</p><p>I could not reproduce and the more I read the related code,
the more it read correct.
Futhermore,
he reported that the previous version of OpenSMTPD worked flawlessly,
and I couldn&rsquo;t see any relevant change that could led to his crash.</p><p>I couldn&rsquo;t reproduce so it took a long while to investigate,
but eventually we managed to obtain a backtrace which pinpointed <code>freeaddrinfo()</code> as being the culprit.</p><p>So what happened ?</p><p>On one side we have <code>getaddrinfo()</code> which resolves a node into a serie of <code>struct sockaddr *</code> wrapped inside a <code>struct addrinfo *</code> providing the linked list:</p><div class=highlight><pre tabindex=0 style=color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#282a36;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4><code class=language-c data-lang=c><span style=display:flex><span><span style=color:#ff79c6>struct</span> addrinfo {

</span></span></code></pre></div><p>This version assumes an underlying <code>struct aibuf *</code> where the items of <code>struct addrinfo *</code> are stored,
not really as a linked list,
but rather as contiguous items linked together.
This allows musl to do pointer arithmetics to locate elements of the list,
it however diverges greatly from other implementations.</p><p>Not saying this at all as a critique to code quality,
but I <em>personally</em> have trouble understanding this code,
I&rsquo;m unable to understand from reading only if this violates the standard:</p><pre><code>The freeaddrinfo() function shall support the freeing of arbitrary sublists of an addrinfo list originally returned by getaddrinfo().
</code></pre><p>Intuitively the code seems to not accept <code>freeaddrinfo()</code> being called on the second element of the addrinfo list,
but I may very well be wrong and this needs testing,
maybe the next time I spin an alpine VM.</p><p>What is certain however is that <code>struct aibuf *</code> is a musl internal thing.
The consequence being that if <code>freeaddrinfo()</code> expects to find it,
then it can only be called on a <code>struct addrinfo *</code> that was built through <code>getaddrinfo()</code>.</p><p>Unluckily for us,
OpenSMTPD comes with an asynchronous resolver that crafts its own <code>struct addrinfo *</code>.
This results in a linked list that won&rsquo;t have the underlying <code>struct aibuf *</code> and will work everywhere&mldr; but on musl.</p><p>But then,
how comes the previous version of OpenSMTPD worked flawlessly then?</p><p>Here&rsquo;s the version of <code>freeaddrinfo()</code> that musl used until October 2018:</p><div class=highlight><pre tabindex=0 style=color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#282a36;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4><code class=language-c data-lang=c><span style=display:flex><span><span style=color:#8be9fd>void</span> <span style=color:#50fa7b>freeaddrinfo</span>(<span style=color:#ff79c6>struct</span> addrinfo <span style=color:#ff79c6>*</span>p)

</span></span><span style=display:flex><span>}
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>It <strong>didn&rsquo;t</strong> work flawlessly.</p><p>What happened was that before October 2018 the musl code didn&rsquo;t have an underlying structure,
so it didn&rsquo;t crash when playing pointer arithmetic tricks to locate elements from the list.
It however already assumed a unique contiguous chunk of memory and released it as a whole so,
when passed the linked list OpenSMTPD crafted,
it would <em>partially</em> release the first item of the list and leak members from that item as well as the entire sublist.</p><p>I will contact the musl maintainers to see if they have a plan for this or won&rsquo;t fix,
however in the meantime I have introduced a <code>portable_freeaddrinfo()</code> to OpenSMTPD,
as a work-around,
so that whenever we call <code>getaddrinfo()</code> we release with <code>freeaddrinfo()</code>,
but whenever we craft a list ourselves we release with <code>portable_freeaddrinfo()</code>,
effectively making OpenSMTPD work again correctly with musl.</p><h2 id=autoconf-and-openbsd-compat-cleaned-up>autoconf and openbsd-compat/ cleaned up</h2><p>Our portable layer was released many many years ago thanks to the work of Charles Longeau,
who bootstrapped the OpenSMTPD portable project by gathering bits of the compat layer from OpenSSH and OpenNTPD.
This allowed us to make OpenSMTPD available to FreeBSD, NetBSD and Linux after a few weeks or work,
broadening our community and helping us get more reports to improve the software.</p><p>Neither of us was an expert in autohell and mistakes were made back then,
which we worked around throughout the years,
and things worked fairly fine as long as we didn&rsquo;t look too much into details.</p><p>The compat layer was meant to provide the features we detected as missing on a target system,
however it built the entire compat layer and played <code>#ifdef</code> games to exclude sections of code we didn&rsquo;t need on a host.
In some cases, the <code>#ifdef</code> didn&rsquo;t properly exclude everything and resulted in compat layer carrying a function that it shouldn&rsquo;t.
For functions like <code>strlcpy()</code> this wouldn&rsquo;t be an issue because who cares if we&rsquo;re using OpenSMTPD&rsquo;s version over the systems&rsquo;,
but for some others this was an issue.</p><p>The <code>arc4random()</code> section above described one case of where this could be an issue,
because we might pick a less preferable implementation,
or it might pick the proper implementation but shadow an underlying symbol with consequences ranging from nothing to a crash.</p><p>Another case is the <em>OpenSMTPD portable on top of OpenBSD</em> case.
It makes sense that building OpenSMTPD portable on top of OpenBSD should result in an empty compat layer since&mldr;
well, there should be no missing OpenBSD function in OpenBSD.</p><p>In practice, the compat layer still carried things and this made me uncomfortable.
For years I discouraged using OpenSMTPD portable on top of OpenBSD,
claiming it was unsupported,
but this was an intuitive claim and while technically there should be no issue,
something felt really wrong about it.</p><center><img src=2019-11-17-portable.jpg></center><p>Then OpenBSD&rsquo;s <code>pledge()</code> system call came to the scene and my worry became very real:
building OpenSMTPD portable on OpenBSD led to an executable that would crash at startup.
The compat layer didn&rsquo;t properly exclude a replacement function,
which relied upon a system call that we didn&rsquo;t allow in our pledges.
<strong>BOOM.</strong></p><p>I proceeded to rework the compat layer and fix a few things:</p><p>First of all,
I have removed pretty much EVERYTHING that&rsquo;s not needed for OpenSMTPD.
Among the things we carried from OpenSSH or OpenNTPD are functions which are never used in OpenSMTPD,
and so I have removed their detection in configure as well as their replacement implementations in the compat layer.
Anything we have in the compat layer is now needed.</p><p>Then,
I have cleaned up a bit the function detection in configure.ac to make sure that functions we need replacements for are properly detected.
There is still work to do in terms of handling priorities,
as in &ldquo;do I pick the system&rsquo;s or the one from a library&rdquo;,
but the logic to handle all detections THEN ULTIMATELY decide if we want a replacement is already there.</p><p>Finally,
I have switched from a mode where the compat layer is built with all of its <code>.c</code> files included but sprinkled with <code>#ifdef</code> to exclude portions,
to a mode where the compat layer conditionally includes <code>.c</code> files based on <code>configure</code> detection.
This has the nice side-effects that we can&rsquo;t accidentally carry something that was not properly <code>#ifdef</code>-ed,
but also that you can spot at build time what&rsquo;s included or not on a target host,
which can raise eyebrows right away if you see <code>arc4random.c</code> built on a system which provides <code>arc4random()</code> for instance.</p><p>This is already in place in the portable branch,
so this is what you get on an OpenBSD system:</p><pre tabindex=0><code>laptop$ make

I wrote <a href=https://github.com/poolpOrg/filter-senderscore target=_blank rel=noopener>filter-senderscore</a> which looks up the reputation for a source address in the SenderScore database,
and allows blocking, junking and delaying sessions whose score falls below some threshold.</p><p>The filter works fairly well so I didn&rsquo;t bother making any improvement to it.</p><p>In <a href=/posts/2019-09-21/september-2019-report-jules-opensmtpd-6.6.0-upcoming-release-and-related-things/>September</a>,
the <code>junk</code> action was introduced which allows a filter to tell that a session or transaction can be junked by OpenSMTPD.
Since the filter was written before that feature,
it did the junking itself by registering for the dataline phase and injecting a <code>X-Spam: yes</code> header,
so I simplified by having the filter use the <code>junk</code> action instead.</p><p>While I was there,
I thought it would be nice to add an option to let user configure at which phase the client should be disconnected.
Until now,
if the <code>-blockBelow</code> option was provided and the reputation for an IP fell below the threshold,
the session would be disconnected at the banner.
The new <code>-blockPhase</code> option allows deferring the disconnect to later,
making it possible to track the sender or recipient addresses before disconnecting if needed.</p><h2 id=filter-greylist-proof-of-concept>filter-greylist proof-of-concept</h2><p>The SMTP protocol provides a mechanism for &ldquo;temporary failures&rdquo; which requests a sender to retry transfer of a message.
A regular MTA like OpenSMTPD will honor that request but scripts and spam tools that are targeted at spamming <em>en masse</em> will not necessarily retry,
as it would slow them and force them to keep track of which hosts need to be retried.</p><p>The idea behind greylisting is to trigger a temporary failure voluntarily when first contacted by an MX,
then keep a reasonnable window of time within which the MX should perform a retry.
If the MX retries in that timeframe then it is whitelisted,
otherwise it is either blacklisted or kept in temporary-failure-land forever.</p><p>Multiple greylisting solutions exist,
including the <code>spamd(8)</code><a href=https://man.openbsd.org/spamd target=_blank rel=noopener>(man page)</a> daemon in OpenBSD.
A lot of them are unusable <em>as is</em> with big mailers like Gmail / Yahoo / Hotmail because their retries do not come from the same MX host and they never get whitelisted.</p><p>A few years ago,
I introduced an <code>spf walk</code> utility which made things a bit better.</p><p>What it did was to perform an SPF walk to catch as many IP addresses as it could from an SPF record to they could be whitelisted.
Since all big mailers publish SPF records, it improved considerably the situation.</p><p>It wasn&rsquo;t perfect either because some SPF records are context-dependant and can&rsquo;t be looked up,
others rely on hostnames which have geo-localized IP addresses preventing whitelists from being shared across countries,
and finally whitelisting this way didn&rsquo;t account for updates of SPF records&mldr;
so <code>spf walk</code> had to be ran frequently and there was always a possibility that an SPF change happened right after a run.
A lot of people see <code>spf walk</code> as THE solution to the big mailer greylisting issue, but I don&rsquo;t.</p><p>I wrote <code>filter-greylist</code> as a proof-of-concept for an SPF-aware greylisting.</p><p>What it does is consider that there are two kind of senders,
those that do SPF and those that don&rsquo;t.
If a host doesn&rsquo;t do SPF, then retries are expected to come from the same IP address.
If a host does SPF, then the sending domain is remembered and ALL IP addresses part of the SPF record are considered as valid for the retry.
This means that if Gmail contacts from an IP, then retries from another, this will be considered as a valid retry.</p><p>I have been running with this filter for weeks and it works perfect,
to the point where I had actually forgotten that it was running.</p><p>The filter <a href=https://github.com/poolpOrg/filter-greylist target=_blank rel=noopener>has been published on Github</a> but since this is a bit more risky than my other filters,
test at your own risks.</p><h2 id=2-chapters-of-the-book-written>2 chapters of the book written</h2><p>I have written two additional chapters to my OpenSMTPD book.</p><p>I&rsquo;m now focusing on the configuration examples which is probably the most interesting part for readers,
but by far the most annoying part to write for me given how many features we support :-)</p><h2 id=what-next->What next ?</h2><p>It&rsquo;s unclear what I&rsquo;ll do in December because I have multiple works in progress,
the table API will be worked on for sure,
the smtp-out reporting also.</p><p>I&rsquo;d like to improve my filter-greylist proof of concept but it&rsquo;s not high priority for me,
I&rsquo;ll be happy to review pull requests ;-)</p><p>I have started writing articles outside of my monthly reports,
however they grow really big really fast,
I need to find how to properly split.</p><hr><p>Comments: <a href=https://github.com/poolpOrg/poolp.org/discussions/109 target=_blank rel=noopener>https://github.com/poolpOrg/poolp.org/discussions/109</a></p><script src=https://giscus.app/client.js data-repo=poolpOrg/poolp.org data-repo-id="MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMjYxODk2MjA=" data-category=Articles data-category-id=DIC_kwDOB4WANM4B-Zf1 data-mapping=og:title data-strict=0 data-reactions-enabled=1 data-emit-metadata=1 data-input-position=top data-theme=light data-lang=en data-loading=lazy crossorigin=anonymous async></script></article></div></div><script type=text/javascript src=/main.js defer></script></body></html>
