- this is a short article, no TL;DR.</blockquote><center><img src=cover.jpeg height=300px></center><h1 id=why-so-calm->Why so calm ?</h1><p>As some of you know,
I was diagnosed a few years ago with <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generalized_anxiety_disorder>generalized anxiety disorder</a>,
<a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Panic_disorder>panic disorder</a> and
<a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexithymia>alexithymia</a>,
a trait that makes it particularly difficult for me to cope with the disorders.</p><p>As <a href=https://poolp.org/posts/2019-06-02/happy-new-year-2019-a-personal-post/>I wrote in 2019</a>,
I didn&rsquo;t take the alexithymia diagnosis too well.
It took me a long time to stop ruminating,
move forward,
and start trying to find a fix for myself with virtually no help.
It turns out that I have made huge progress thanks to hypnosis and efforts at trying to decode sensations into emotions,
but the road is still long and full of ups and downs.</p><p>This brings us to 2021,
two years later.</p><p>Too many things hinted me that a neurodivergence was at the root of my problems,
I could no longer pretend not to see it.
I took a psychological assessment which confirmed my intuition,
then took the report to a different psychologist for a second opinion and got a confirmation.</p><p><strong>I&rsquo;m neurodivergent.</strong></p><p>I don&rsquo;t want to share the details because it doesn&rsquo;t really matter how divergent I am,
but just like in 2019,
I don&rsquo;t take this news too well and I need some time to accept it.</p><p><strong>I&rsquo;m ok, no worries</strong>, nothing a summer alone with my wife and kid can&rsquo;t fix.</p><h1 id=a-quick-word-about-sponsorship-and-this-blog>A quick word about sponsorship and this blog</h1><p>If you are sponsoring me,
<strong>please take a time to reconsider</strong> if you still want to support me.</p><p>I have 5 days each month that I can dedicate however I want and,
out of these 5 days,
1 is almost fully consumed by the monthly report because I&rsquo;m a slow writer.
I only have 4 days I can use to work on stuff and,
because the monthly report can&rsquo;t be empty,
within these 4 days I must find things to do that I can write about.</p><p>This doesn&rsquo;t leave much room for learning new skills and doing useless experiments.
I find myself working on interesting stuff (to me),
then watching the clock because I want to leave enough time to work on something I can write about.
Who wants to read about my experiments converting EEG metrics to midi so I can listen to my brain waves ?
Obviously, people prefer when I write code that brings new features in OpenSMTPD.</p><p>In June and July,
I spent my days unsuccessfully trying to do some VR,
and this didn&rsquo;t leave me time to write the monthly reports.
I felt bad for my sponsors as I couldn&rsquo;t deliver reports,
I had 0 things to write.</p><p>Since the beginning of August,
I&rsquo;m experimenting with Dart/Flutter to write a mobile app using a Golang backend and a cockroach database.
It&rsquo;s a fun project that I&rsquo;ll eventually publish and write about but if I want to produce a monthly report,
I need to stop right away and dive into code I&rsquo;m familiar with so I know I can produce something fast enough,
rather than continue working on a fun new project that I can&rsquo;t write about <strong>yet</strong>.</p><p>I find this counter-productive,
the monthly reports are preventing me from working on what I want,
I think it is time to stop this format which is putting too much pressure on me and <strong>limiting future projects</strong>.</p><p>Instead,
I will write reports when I have valuable informations to share,
and continue to commit everything to Github.
Sometimes you will see a lot of activity on consecutive months,
sometimes you will not see anything happening for a quarter.</p><p>If you&rsquo;re not ok with that,
I understand and am grateful for your support until this point &lt;3</p><p>I sent a notice to all my patrons so they are aware that I will change my way of working.</p><p>Love &lt;3</p><hr><p>Comments: <a href=https://github.com/poolpOrg/poolp.org/discussions/133>https://github.com/poolpOrg/poolp.org/discussions/133</a></p></div><div class="row PageNavigation d-flex justify-content-between font-weight-bold"><a class="d-block col-md-6" href=https://poolp.org/posts/2021-10-26/october-2021-mostly-plakar/>&#171; October 2021: mostly Plakar</a>
