This post won't need a TL;DR as I'll keep it short. Generalized anxiety disorder and alexithymia. Late 2018, I&rsquo;ve been diagnosed with generalized anxiety disorder and alexithymia a couple weeks apart.
The anxiety disorder didn&rsquo;t really come as a surprise as I know very well the traumatic experience that led to the disorder. It&rsquo;ll still take a lot of hours of hypnosis to continue cleaning up trauma after trauma, but taking care of it and releasing some of the traumas has improved considerably my anxiety.</div></a><a class="article block px-3 py-4 hover:bg-slate-200 dark:hover:bg-slate-700" href=/posts/2018-12-21/opensmtpd-now-supports-regex-in-match-rules/><h3 class="text-lg font-semibold mb-0.5">OpenSMTPD now supports regex in match rules</h3><div class="text-sm text-slate-500 dark:text-slate-400 line-clamp-2">TL;DR: regex table lookups were introduced for builtin filters. After a few weeks of working solely on filters, I wanted to work on something else. Using the same mechanism, all match criterias using tables can support regex. K_REGEX lookups The table mechanism is used within OpenSMTPD to perform all kinds of lookups.
Recently, while working on builtin filters, I introduced the K_REGEX lookup type allowing tables to serve regex(3) patterns.</div></a><a class="article block px-3 py-4 hover:bg-slate-200 dark:hover:bg-slate-700" href=/posts/2018-12-19/more-on-opensmtpd-filters/><h3 class="text-lg font-semibold mb-0.5">more on OpenSMTPD filters</h3><div class="text-sm text-slate-500 dark:text-slate-400 line-clamp-2">TL;DR: Not this time, pal/gal, I took hours writing this post, you'll take a few minutes reading it all. Oh, and merry X-mas :-* A bit of short-sighted history The filtering feature has been introduced only recently in OpenSMTPD, first presented on this blog a month ago.
I had a working proof-of-concept running on my laptop and my plan was to start bringing the code to the OpenBSD tree, small chunks by small chunks, through a serie of diffs.</div></a><a class="article block px-3 py-4 hover:bg-slate-200 dark:hover:bg-slate-700" href=/posts/2018-12-06/opensmtpd-proc-filters-fc-rdns/><h3 class="text-lg font-semibold mb-0.5">OpenSMTPD proc filters & fc-rDNS</h3><div class="text-sm text-slate-500 dark:text-slate-400 line-clamp-2">TL;DR: I *FINALFUCKINGLY* commited proc filters support allowing full filtering in OpenSMTPD. eric@ implemented fc-rDNS lookups. fc-rDNS fc-rDNS, or forward-confirmed reverse DNS, consists in performing a reverse DNS lookup to determine the hostname associated to an IP address&mldr; then performing a DNS lookup on that hostname to check if it resolves back to the IP address.
On my request, eric@ implemented fc-rDNS lookups in our SMTP engine, causing OpenSMTPD to perform the double lookup upon clients connections.</div></a><a class="article block px-3 py-4 hover:bg-slate-200 dark:hover:bg-slate-700" href=/posts/2018-11-09/opensmtpd-reporting-update/><h3 class="text-lg font-semibold mb-0.5">OpenSMTPD reporting update</h3><div class="text-sm text-slate-500 dark:text-slate-400 line-clamp-2">TL;DR: The reporting mechanism has been described shortly in my previous article about both reporting and filters. Let's focus a bit more on the reporting bits this time. The format is improving further and has extended to outgoing trafic reporting. Reporting In previous article, I described the events reporting mechanism that has been introduced in the development branch of OpenSMTPD.
To sum it up, you could now write an event processor as simple as a shell script reading its stdin on a loop:</div></a><a class="article block px-3 py-4 bg-slate-900 dark:bg-slate-700 text-slate-50" href=/posts/2018-11-03/opensmtpd-released-and-upcoming-filters-preview/><h3 class="text-lg font-semibold mb-0.5">OpenSMTPD released and upcoming filters preview</h3><div class="text-sm text-slate-400 line-clamp-2">TL;DR: Filters have been a (the most ?) long awaited feature in OpenSMTPD. I finally committed most of the filters code to OpenBSD. There is still a bit of work required but the trickiest parts are done. This article describes how filters are implemented and what to expect. OpenSMTPD 6.4.0 was released ! We have released OpenSMTPD 6.4.0 last week without filters.
I won&rsquo;t expand on the features in the 6.</div></a><a class="article block px-3 py-4 hover:bg-slate-200 dark:hover:bg-slate-700" href=/posts/2018-05-21/switching-to-opensmtpd-new-config/><h3 class="text-lg font-semibold mb-0.5">switching to OpenSMTPD new config</h3><div class="text-sm text-slate-500 dark:text-slate-400 line-clamp-2">TL;DR: Switching to new config is not too hard and can be done in minutes. The new config is also a new queue that is not backwards compatible. The easiest way is to flush the mail queue before switching. We came up with a solution to help maintainers of more complex setups. Switching from old config to new config The new OpenSMTPD configuration grammar is slightly different from the current one, rules are no longer stated as single lines, but the conversion from previous ruleset to new ruleset isn&rsquo;t that hard.</div></a><a class="article block px-3 py-4 hover:bg-slate-200 dark:hover:bg-slate-700" href=/posts/2018-04-30/opensmtpd-new-config/><h3 class="text-lg font-semibold mb-0.5">OpenSMTPD new config</h3><div class="text-sm text-slate-500 dark:text-slate-400 line-clamp-2">TL;DR: OpenBSD #p2k18 hackathon took place at Epitech in Nantes. I was organizing the hackathon but managed to make progress on OpenSMTPD. As mentionned at EuroBSDCon the one-line per rule config format was a design error. A new configuration grammar is almost ready and the underlying structures are simplified. Refactor removes ~750 lines of code and solves _many_ issues that were side-effects of the design error. New features are going to be unlocked thanks to this.</div></a><a class="article block px-3 py-4 hover:bg-slate-200 dark:hover:bg-slate-700" href=/posts/2018-01-29/install-openbsd-on-dedibox-with-full-disk-encryption/><h3 class="text-lg font-semibold mb-0.5">Install OpenBSD on dedibox with full-disk encryption</h3><div class="text-sm text-slate-500 dark:text-slate-400 line-clamp-2">TL;DR: I run several "dedibox" servers at online.net, all powered by OpenBSD.

Aaron Poffenberger wrote a shell-based `spf_fetch` utility. I wrote a C-based `spfwalk` utility that's `pledge()`-ed. The `spfwalk` utility got merged to `smtpctl`. What&rsquo;s SPF in a few words SPF is the Sender Policy Framework, a standard to verify the domain name of an e-mail sender.
Long story short, the SMTP protocol does not come with a way to authenticate a domain and, during an SMTP session, nothing really prevents a sender from pretending to come from any domain:</div></a><a class="article block px-3 py-4 hover:bg-slate-200 dark:hover:bg-slate-700" href=/posts/2018-01-08/news-from-the-front/><h3 class="text-lg font-semibold mb-0.5">News from the front !</h3><div class="text-sm text-slate-500 dark:text-slate-400 line-clamp-2">TL;DR: Came very close to a burn out late 2016, had to quit former employer.

Turns out most of the changes are not visible. A featureless release I managed to wrap the 6.0.0 release yesterday.
Unlike most of our releases, it comes out with almost no new feature.
The changelog fits in less than 10 lines as follows:
- new fork+reexec model so each process has its own randomized memory space - logging format has been reworked - a "multi-line response" bug in the LMTP delivery backend has been fixed - connections concurrency limits have been bumped - artificial delaying in remote sessions have been reduced - dhparams option has been removed - dhe option has been added, supporting auto and legacy modes - smtp engine has been simplified - various cosmethic changes, code cleanup and documentation improvement Seems like a very productive slacking, however some of these changes turn out to be very interesting in terms of code simplification and security.</div></a><a class="article block px-3 py-4 hover:bg-slate-200 dark:hover:bg-slate-700" href=/posts/2015-12-22/home-sweet-home/><h3 class="text-lg font-semibold mb-0.5">Home, sweet home</h3><div class="text-sm text-slate-500 dark:text-slate-400 line-clamp-2">TL;DR: OpenSMTPD on github no longer diverges from OpenBSD. Since last episode Sometime this year, we released OpenSMTPD 5.7.1 which was the first version that shipped with the long-awaited experimental filters support. The result of over a year and a half of very very deep refactor in our IO layer and the addition of a very elegant but also very tricky new API.
This refactor took place outside the OpenBSD tree because it required breaking a lot of code for extended period of times, which spanned over 3 OpenBSD releases.</div></a><a class="article block px-3 py-4 hover:bg-slate-200 dark:hover:bg-slate-700" href=/posts/2014-12-12/the-state-of-filters/><h3 class="text-lg font-semibold mb-0.5">The state of filters</h3><div class="text-sm text-slate-500 dark:text-slate-400 line-clamp-2">TL;DR: yeeeees, filters are coming. don't believe us ? here's an example. be patient. On my death bed On my death bed, when my life flashes before my eyes and I start recalling what people have told me during my (hopefully long) lifetime, these sentences will single out:
&ldquo;When will OpenSMTPD support filters ? I need it.&rdquo;
Not that it carries a philosophical meaning that will have taken me a lifetime of thinking, but because for the last three years I have been hearing this every time I met someone IRL and discussed OpenSMTPD, I have read it on our Github issues tracker, on GTalk, on IRC, on Twitter, on Facebook, on random forums, and just this week three times in my mailbox.</div></a><a class="article block px-3 py-4 hover:bg-slate-200 dark:hover:bg-slate-700" href=/posts/2014-12-10/some-opensmtpd-overview-part-3/><h3 class="text-lg font-semibold mb-0.5">Some OpenSMTPD overview, part 3</h3><div class="text-sm text-slate-500 dark:text-slate-400 line-clamp-2">EHLO,
This is the third post of a series about OpenSMTPD improvements that have taken place since this summer.
Content altering For a long time, we have developed OpenSMTPD with a strict rule that the daemon should not alter DATA (as in the DATA SMTP phase) in any way.
The rationale was that by enforcing that rule, the message writing was simplified as the smtp process would simply read data from a client and write it, without any post-processing, to a file descriptor.</div></a><a class="article block px-3 py-4 hover:bg-slate-200 dark:hover:bg-slate-700" href=/posts/2014-12-01/some-opensmtpd-overview-part-2/><h3 class="text-lg font-semibold mb-0.5">Some OpenSMTPD overview, part 2</h3><div class="text-sm text-slate-500 dark:text-slate-400 line-clamp-2">Why we killed the MFA (filter) process For as long as I can remember, a process called MFA was created by OpenSMTPD at start time.
MFA stood for &ldquo;Mail Filter Agent&rdquo; and the goal of that process was initially to take care of all filtering tasks ranging from filtering senders based on the ruleset matching to starting and controlling filters.
As time passed by, we figured the lookup process was better suited for ruleset matching and the MFA process became mostly idle, we renamed it to &ldquo;filter&rdquo; process since the only thing it had to do was take care of starting filters and making sure they had the proper environment.</div></a><a class="article block px-3 py-4 hover:bg-slate-200 dark:hover:bg-slate-700" href=/posts/2014-11-26/some-opensmtpd-overview-part-1/><h3 class="text-lg font-semibold mb-0.5">Some OpenSMTPD overview, part 1</h3><div class="text-sm text-slate-500 dark:text-slate-400 line-clamp-2">EHLO world ! Yesterday I thought I&rsquo;d write a first OpenSMTPD-related post to sum up the changes that have happened since this summer but it turned out to be painful as they amount to quite a lot. Instead, I think a better strategy is to split this into a serie of smaller posts focused on the specific changes ;-)
So, in June I have organized a mini hackathon at my brand new place and invited some of the French Connection at home.</div></a><a class="article block px-3 py-4 hover:bg-slate-200 dark:hover:bg-slate-700" href=/posts/2014-11-24/what-the-fsck-did-just-happen/><h3 class="text-lg font-semibold mb-0.5">what the fsck did just happen</h3><div class="text-sm text-slate-500 dark:text-slate-400 line-clamp-2">Good news everyone !
With last post dating from almost a year, we can all agree that I&rsquo;ve outpassed my slacking skills by a great margin and I probably deserve an award of some kind ;-)
Anyways, there&rsquo;s been a few complaints during these 12 months because this blog was the main source of information for the OpenSMTPD project and several posts which used to describe features and configuration samples had suddenly disappeared.</div></a><a class="article block px-3 py-4 hover:bg-slate-200 dark:hover:bg-slate-700" href=/posts/2013-12-14/news-from-the-front/><h3 class="text-lg font-semibold mb-0.5">News-from-the-front</h3><div class="text-sm text-slate-500 dark:text-slate-400 line-clamp-2">EHLO readers,
This blog post is the first since a few months, I&rsquo;ve been busy and struggling with some personal health and familial issues. I won&rsquo;t share them here as its not really something anyone can help with, so&mldr; let&rsquo;s focus on OpenSMTPD !

I have not updated this blog since the release of OpenSMTPD 5.3, over a month ago. In the meantime, some minor bugs have been fixed and we have released OpenSMTPD 5.3.1.
The main reason for the silence is that I was busy with completely unrelated day-time work, unrelated opensource code, the OpenSMTPD book in progress and some minor health issues that have caused endless side-effects keeping my mind away from this blog.</div></a><a class="article block px-3 py-4 hover:bg-slate-200 dark:hover:bg-slate-700" href=/posts/2013-03-17/opensmtpd-5.3-released/><h3 class="text-lg font-semibold mb-0.5">OpenSMTPD 5.3 released</h3><div class="text-sm text-slate-500 dark:text-slate-400 line-clamp-2">OHAI !

We had planned to slow down a bit to prepare for release: no more feature, no more invasive changes until we tag something out of which we can publish a release. I then discussed with Bret Lambert (blambert@) and he asked me if we used some kind of code scanner to detect defects in our code.
We do use the clang static analyzer every now and then, the last time being a couple week ago, and we spend a few minutes cleaning up the defects we believe to be real issues.</div></a><a class="article block px-3 py-4 hover:bg-slate-200 dark:hover:bg-slate-700" href=/posts/2013-01-25/opensmtpd-gentlemen-fasten-your-seatbelt/><h3 class="text-lg font-semibold mb-0.5">OpenSMTPD: gentlemen, fasten your seatbelt</h3><div class="text-sm text-slate-500 dark:text-slate-400 line-clamp-2">OHAI,
Lately we have stabilized and decided that we&rsquo;re okay with the features we have for our first release, this time for good, so we focused on making sure that we didn&rsquo;t introduce regressions and that we were rock solid.
We stressed incoming and outgoing path and found areas of improvements. This will be a long-standing task, but we have already improved memory usage considerably under high-load, we&rsquo;re pretty happy with the result.</div></a><a class="article block px-3 py-4 hover:bg-slate-200 dark:hover:bg-slate-700" href=/posts/2013-01-18/opensmtpd-stress-and-features/><h3 class="text-lg font-semibold mb-0.5">OpenSMTPD: stress and features</h3><div class="text-sm text-slate-500 dark:text-slate-400 line-clamp-2">&lt;p>Hey,&lt;/p> I wanted to publish something last Friday but I unfortunately got my hands on a copy of Super Nintendo's Zelda which led to an instant loss of motivation.
Here's a quick summary of what happened recently in OpenSMTPD-land, it's not an exhaustive description and to be honest I'm keeping a lot of information private at this point and probably until release ;-)
A snapshot should be published tomorrow.

I know I should have posted a &ldquo;Happy New Year&rdquo; note earlier but you know how it is: new year eve&rsquo;s aftermath, days to recover, work resumes, mood slacks, bleh.
Anyway, today&rsquo;s note is simply about that: wishing you and me an awesome year 2013 and hoping you will not turn it into a fucking mess. After all, you&rsquo;re in charge so we know who to blame ;-)
As far as I&rsquo;m concerned, year 2012 wasn&rsquo;t &ldquo;great&rdquo;, it was not the absolute suck either, it was even quite decent.</div></a><a class="article block px-3 py-4 hover:bg-slate-200 dark:hover:bg-slate-700" href=/posts/2012-12-28/opensmtpd-ssl-relay-stuff/><h3 class="text-lg font-semibold mb-0.5">OpenSMTPD: SSL & relay stuff</h3><div class="text-sm text-slate-500 dark:text-slate-400 line-clamp-2">OHAI,
I was unable to write a story last week as my desk broke into pieces for no apparent reason but my foot hitting it accidentally.
I still don&rsquo;t have a desk so I will make this short by not telling about the queue profiling and SQL log conversion I wrote, and not even writing about the filter work done by Eric, he&rsquo;ll write about it if he wants to or I&rsquo;ll do that next time.</div></a><a class="article block px-3 py-4 hover:bg-slate-200 dark:hover:bg-slate-700" href=/posts/2012-12-14/opensmtpd-ldap-support-selectable-source-dkim-and-goodies/><h3 class="text-lg font-semibold mb-0.5">OpenSMTPD: LDAP support, selectable source, DKIM and Goodies</h3><div class="text-sm text-slate-500 dark:text-slate-400 line-clamp-2">&lt;p>OHAI,&lt;/p> This week has been crazy, my brain melted a little as I worked on filters, it melted a little as I worked on LDAP and it melted a little more as I tried to trick Eric into working on filters with me (yes, that actually worked :-).
Anyway, as usual, this is just going to be a summary of what we did as tons of little stuff have been committed here and there.</div></a><a class="article block px-3 py-4 hover:bg-slate-200 dark:hover:bg-slate-700" href=/posts/2012-12-07/opensmtpd-fully-virtual-setups-updated-dns-mta-code-sqlite-support/><h3 class="text-lg font-semibold mb-0.5">OpenSMTPD: fully virtual setups, updated DNS & MTA code, SQLite support</h3><div class="text-sm text-slate-500 dark:text-slate-400 line-clamp-2">OHAI,
This week I had intended to work on filters. After 3 days of pain and swearing, even though it did move forward, I finally decided to step back for a few days and work on something else to preserve my sanity.
As you may have guessed, this week has not been too productive&mldr; Oh wait, yes it has ! It&rsquo;s actually been incredibly productive :-)
Just as usual, I will only write a summary for this week, the complete changelog can be retrieved from our mirror on Github.</div></a><a class="article block px-3 py-4 hover:bg-slate-200 dark:hover:bg-slate-700" href=/posts/2012-11-30/opensmtpd-more-features-more-cleanup-more-more/><h3 class="text-lg font-semibold mb-0.5">OpenSMTPD: more features, more cleanup, more more</h3><div class="text-sm text-slate-500 dark:text-slate-400 line-clamp-2">OHAI,
First of all, on a completely unrelated note, I&rsquo;d like to emphasize that this blog post is being written from my text editor launched by a little shell and pushed to poolp using the Ocean API. I can be web2.0 from console and emacs, and that&rsquo;s definitely worth a mention ;-)
As has become a habit, a lot of work has been poured in OpenSMTPD this week, here is an incomplete summary of the most notable changes.</div></a><a class="article block px-3 py-4 hover:bg-slate-200 dark:hover:bg-slate-700" href=/posts/2012-11-17/news-from-the-front/><h3 class="text-lg font-semibold mb-0.5">News from the front</h3><div class="text-sm text-slate-500 dark:text-slate-400 line-clamp-2">Almost a month since my last post&mldr; I know, I know.
So I left my position at Scality two weeks ago. I had been there for a year and a half working on a very interesting and tricky project. I will miss my colleagues and the discussions we had on all kinds of topic, I hope them the best future and that we will be able to share beers again ;-)</div></a><a class="article block px-3 py-4 hover:bg-slate-200 dark:hover:bg-slate-700" href=/posts/2012-08-31/opensmtpd-crypto/compress-fixes-and-import-initial-stab-at-ldap/><h3 class="text-lg font-semibold mb-0.5">OpenSMTPD: crypto/compress fixes and import initial stab at LDAP</h3><div class="text-sm text-slate-500 dark:text-slate-400 line-clamp-2">The crypto backend that has been committed a couple days ago started a little discussion and it was decided to switch the default cipher from Blowfish to AES-128 and make it a default.
Encryption can now be enabled as simply as:
queue encryption key &ldquo;foobar&rdquo;
That being said, Charles cleaned up a bit the compression code to make it use FILE* instead of file descriptors. This allows us to ensure we don&rsquo;t have to deal with any buffering and interruption handling code.</div></a><a class="article block px-3 py-4 hover:bg-slate-200 dark:hover:bg-slate-700" href=/posts/2012-08-29/opensmtpd-crypto_backend-and-encrypted-queue/><h3 class="text-lg font-semibold mb-0.5">OpenSMTPD: crypto_backend and encrypted queue</h3><div class="text-sm text-slate-500 dark:text-slate-400 line-clamp-2">A few days ago, Charles committed the compress_backend API which allowed transparent deflation/inflation of envelopes and messages as they hit the queue.
The compression code is executed before the queue_backend gets the data so that any queue_backend can benefit transparently from compression without having to add any code to handle it. Due to our design, this also means that if the queue_backend stores envelopes and messages remotely, then the compression will take place before sending and after fetching, the remote end only ever sees compressed data.</div></a><a class="article block px-3 py-4 hover:bg-slate-200 dark:hover:bg-slate-700" href=/posts/2012-08-26/opensmtpd-i-have-no-idea-for-that-title-sorry/><h3 class="text-lg font-semibold mb-0.5">OpenSMTPD: I have no idea for that title, sorry</h3><div class="text-sm text-slate-500 dark:text-slate-400 line-clamp-2">Howdie,
Eric and I had planned a loooooong time ago to have a hackathon this week-end. However, some asshole piece of shit ran into my car while it was parked, made it unable to take the road and flee without leaving a note. Long story made short, I had to be at the repair shop this week-end to be able to get my car before end of September.
We did get our hackathon though and while it was probably much less productive than if we had met in the same room, it was still very very interesting with tons of improvements and many great features written :-p</div></a><a class="article block px-3 py-4 hover:bg-slate-200 dark:hover:bg-slate-700" href=/posts/2012-08-21/opensmtpd-plenty-of-news/><h3 class="text-lg font-semibold mb-0.5">OpenSMTPD: plenty of news</h3><div class="text-sm text-slate-500 dark:text-slate-400 line-clamp-2">It&rsquo;s been over a month since my last post but I have an excuse: I was super busy, then I was super on vacation &mldr; but I&rsquo;m back again ;-)
So my life was pretty intense these last few weeks, both professionnally and on the opensource front. I&rsquo;ll explain later, for now let&rsquo;s just focus on the OpenSMTPD goodies.
OpenSMTPD portable to a new system First of all, I&rsquo;d like to stress out that Rune Lynge and Charles Longeau did an amazing job at porting OpenSMTPD to yet another system &mldr; MacOSX.</div></a><a class="article block px-3 py-4 hover:bg-slate-200 dark:hover:bg-slate-700" href=/posts/2012-07-15/g2k12-openbsd-hackathon-part-ii/><h3 class="text-lg font-semibold mb-0.5">g2k12: OpenBSD hackathon - part II</h3><div class="text-sm text-slate-500 dark:text-slate-400 line-clamp-2">Yesterday, I came back from Budapest and was too tired to write anything, but here&rsquo;s a quick summary of all the features that have been implemented with regard to OpenSMTPD by Eric, Charles and I.
First of all, Eric [eric@] has moved ASR, his asynchronous resolver, to OpenBSD&rsquo;s libc. This is a huge step forward that will allow OpenSMTPD to contain less code, while providing a better coverage of the resolver code.</div></a><a class="article block px-3 py-4 hover:bg-slate-200 dark:hover:bg-slate-700" href=/posts/2012-07-09/g2k12-openbsd-hackathon/><h3 class="text-lg font-semibold mb-0.5">g2k12: OpenBSD hackathon</h3><div class="text-sm text-slate-500 dark:text-slate-400 line-clamp-2">Yesterday, after nearly missing my plane by 5 minutes, I finally managed to make it to Budapest for g2k12, the OpenBSD general hackathon.
While this is not my first hackathon, this is the first general one with many hackers working on all kinds of subsystems ranging from ports to network and kernel. It&rsquo;s fun to see many people focused on improving different areas which you use daily, sometimes without even noticing, and doing it with as much fun as you are having fixing your own area ;-)</div></a><a class="article block px-3 py-4 hover:bg-slate-200 dark:hover:bg-slate-700" href=/posts/2012-06-19/opensmtpd-development-bug-tracker-github/><h3 class="text-lg font-semibold mb-0.5">OpenSMTPD: development, bug tracker & GitHub</h3><div class="text-sm text-slate-500 dark:text-slate-400 line-clamp-2">It&rsquo;s been a while since my last post about OpenSMTPD.
I don&rsquo;t know what Eric and Charles have been up to, I was quite busy with my daytime job and couldn&rsquo;t really spend much time on the hobby ;-)
Anyways, one of the most requested feature of OpenSMTPD is to provide users with a mean to report bugs and let them contribute more easily. It&rsquo;s been requested two times this week, it&rsquo;s been requested countless times in the last few weeks and months, and as a matter of fact it&rsquo;s also been a nuisance for us as until now we&rsquo;ve kept track of bugs and feature requests in my mailbox.</div></a><a class="article block px-3 py-4 hover:bg-slate-200 dark:hover:bg-slate-700" href=/posts/2012-06-06/opensmtpd-rest-queue/><h3 class="text-lg font-semibold mb-0.5">OpenSMTPD REST queue</h3><div class="text-sm text-slate-500 dark:text-slate-400 line-clamp-2">This is the first post of a series to illustrate and describe a &ldquo;proof of concept&rdquo; code by Charles, Eric and I. I will describe the features as they are implemented.
Since mid-November 2011, OpenSMTPD offers support for an extensible queue API. The queue_backend API allows a developer to write a custom storage driver by implementing a small set of functions that take care of storing, updating and removing envelopes and messages.</div></a><a class="article block px-3 py-4 hover:bg-slate-200 dark:hover:bg-slate-700" href=/posts/2012-05-17/opensmtpd-src-address-maps-and-spamhaus/><h3 class="text-lg font-semibold mb-0.5">OpenSMTPD: src-address maps and spamhaus</h3><div class="text-sm text-slate-500 dark:text-slate-400 line-clamp-2">First of all, I&rsquo;d like to &ldquo;thank&rdquo; The Spamhaus project which forced me into hacking this feature in a hurry.
See, I rent a server at online.net which I use for OpenSMTPD live testing and to run some experimental code before it hits the OpenBSD tree.
Yesterday I received a mail from a user complaining that he couldn&rsquo;t send mail to a friend because we were listed on spamhaus. That was very strange because ALL users at poolp.</div></a><a class="article block px-3 py-4 hover:bg-slate-200 dark:hover:bg-slate-700" href=/posts/2012-05-14/opensmtpd-relay-maps-new-url-syntax/><h3 class="text-lg font-semibold mb-0.5">OpenSMTPD relay maps & new url syntax</h3><div class="text-sm text-slate-500 dark:text-slate-400 line-clamp-2">When we first started working on OpenSMTPD, we planned for future features but we did not necessarily start integrating them right away as the goal was to bootstrap the project first with basic features.
Amongst these features was the ability to use mappings for outgoing MX servers. Currently, OpenSMTPD knows two ways of going out:
Using the DNS system to find MX records: accept for [&mldr;] relay
Using the provided mail exchanger: accept for [&mldr;] relay via &ldquo;my-mx.</div></a><a class="article block px-3 py-4 hover:bg-slate-200 dark:hover:bg-slate-700" href=/posts/2012-05-13/opensmtpd-map_compare-and-k_netaddr/><h3 class="text-lg font-semibold mb-0.5">OpenSMTPD, map_compare() and K_NETADDR</h3><div class="text-sm text-slate-500 dark:text-slate-400 line-clamp-2">Ok, I already posted about the new SQLite map_backend earlier today but it turns out that I&rsquo;ve been very productive, and it was worth another post ;-)
So I decided to start improving our maps support and make them usable from places where they weren&rsquo;t.
primary domains
OpenSMTPD supports two kinds of domains: primary domains and virtual domains. The primary domains do not require providing a list of recipients as it will use system accounts; whereas virtual domains require a list of recipients and/or a fallback address to be provided within a map.</div></a><a class="article block px-3 py-4 hover:bg-slate-200 dark:hover:bg-slate-700" href=/posts/2012-05-12/opensmtpd-meets-sqlite/><h3 class="text-lg font-semibold mb-0.5">OpenSMTPD meets SQLite</h3><div class="text-sm text-slate-500 dark:text-slate-400 line-clamp-2">During the r2k12 hackathon in Paris, Marc Espie committed SQLite to OpenBSD&rsquo;s base system.
This has the side effect that OpenSMTPD can start using it and while we agreed that we did not want it as a strong dependency, the various backends API allow us to make it a soft dependency that can be removed without breaking the daemon if someone really does not want SQLite linked.
Today I decided to give it a try and implement a SQLite backend to the map API.</div></a><a class="article block px-3 py-4 hover:bg-slate-200 dark:hover:bg-slate-700" href=/posts/2012-05-09/some-opensmtpd-news/><h3 class="text-lg font-semibold mb-0.5">Some OpenSMTPD news</h3><div class="text-sm text-slate-500 dark:text-slate-400 line-clamp-2">It&rsquo;s been a whiiiiiiile since my last OpenSMTPD related post. Time to break the slacking, blog-wise.
Unlike what would appear from the outside, there&rsquo;s been a lot of activity, discussions and planning, I&rsquo;ll address some here and will discuss it further soon.
First of all, chl@ has committed to a private branch a major improvement to the filter API: async DNS lookups. Due to the design of OpenSMTPD, it is not acceptable for a filter to perform a blocking call as it will prevent it from processing other sessions.</div></a><a class="article block px-3 py-4 hover:bg-slate-200 dark:hover:bg-slate-700" href=/posts/2005-05-21/fatigue-et-envie-de-vacances.../><h3 class="text-lg font-semibold mb-0.5">fatigue et envie de vacances...</h3><div class="text-sm text-slate-500 dark:text-slate-400 line-clamp-2">Je sais pas pourquoi, mais je suis epuise alors que j&rsquo;ai dormi pres de 14h cette nuit.

Filters have been a (the most ?) long awaited feature in OpenSMTPD.
I finally committed most of the filters code to OpenBSD.
There is still a bit of work required but the trickiest parts are done.
This article describes how filters are implemented and what to expect.
</code></pre><p><img src=https://brillianceinsight.files.wordpress.com/2014/02/card-2-24-2014-1_thumb.jpg alt="Good news, everyone!"></p><h2 id=opensmtpd-640-was-released->OpenSMTPD 6.4.0 was released !</h2><p>We have <a href=https://opensmtpd.org/announces/release-6.4.0.txt target=_blank rel=noopener>released OpenSMTPD 6.4.0 last week</a> <strong>without</strong> filters.</p><p>I won&rsquo;t expand on the features in the 6.4 release as I already wrote about the configuration file changes,
the issues that required it and the refactors involved,
this was the one true major feature of the release.</p><p>One notable aspect though is that we dropped our support for OpenSSL in favor of LibreSSL,
and THAT I should expand upon ;-)</p><h2 id=libressl-ftw->LibreSSL FTW !</h2><p>OpenSMTPD was started long before LibreSSL and from the very first portable version,
we had to include ifdefs to accomodate the differences between the different OpenSSL versions across Linux distros:
some had SNI, others don&rsquo;t, some had GCM, others don&rsquo;t.</p><p>When LibreSSL was forked from OpenSSL after a large cleanup of the code,
we thought we&rsquo;d just depend on that because it was cleaner and also we knew that this version had all the features we relied on.
Also, there was this plan for a libtls wrapper which would be much simpler to use and less error-prone than libssl.</p><p>It turned out that it wasn&rsquo;t possible because OpenSSL and LibreSSL couldn&rsquo;t coexist on many systems.
The fact that they shared the same library names (libssl, libcrypto),
and shared object versionning,
caused issues with the confused runtime link editor.
We decided to accomodate both,
keeping checks in the configure layer to detect what was being used, etc&mldr;
It was horrible.
It kept breaking every now and then due to either one making changes.
I had to deal with these breakages.
It was horrible.</p><p>Before the 6.4 release,
I did the portability build passes and yet again it broke on new OpenSSL conflicts with our grammar.
Three different people using different distros had sent me three different diffs which fixed the issues for them,
but which I couldn&rsquo;t merge without creating a delta with the native branch which was not acceptable for us.
The more I tried fixing and the more I was irritated by this OpenSSL/LibreSSL hacks.</p><p>I did a bit of investigation and it turns out the issues that prevented them from coexisting were no longer relevant.
I verified by building, linking and running OpenSMTPD against LibreSSL on FreeBSD, Ubuntu, Debian, CentOS, ArchLinux and Fedora.
It is technically possible to make OpenSMTPD depend on LibreSSL without forcing distros to switch from OpenSSL to LibreSSL,
so there&rsquo;s no reason for us not to depend on LibreSSL anymore.</p><p>This allowed me to start removing ifdefs from our code,
removing useless tests from the configure.ac and assume that we have the features we need for all systems.</p><p>This doesn&rsquo;t mean that people can&rsquo;t link OpenSMTPD against OpenSSL,
it just means that they get to handle the diffs to their own version,
the extra work of maintaining OpenSSL goes out of our hands.</p><h2 id=filters>Filters</h2><p>We started working on filters years ago,
I even <a href=https://poolp.org/posts/2014-12-12/the-state-of-filters/ target=_blank rel=noopener>wrote an article about them in 2014</a>.</p><p>A first implementation was written.
After a while, it became clear that the design was wrong and causing unfixable bugs in some filters.
I decided to pull the plug on that attempt and we removed all of the code.</p><p>A year ago,
<a href="https://youtu.be/wnhvn1rsXR8?t=3056" target=_blank rel=noopener>during EuroBSDCon 2017</a>,
I mentionned the filtering daemon we had worked on and which solved these limitations.
But as OpenBSD 6.4 release was getting closer,
I started to dislike that idea because I believed it was not addressing the proper problem:
we had came up with a working solution, not the best solution to the problem.
The more I spent thinking about this,
the more the problem looked different from what we initially modeled.</p><p>I discussed my concerns with Eric,
told him that I thought we had made a mistake in modeling filters,
that by thinking them differently we could come up with a much simpler solution,
and somehow managed to convince him I was right :-)</p><p>Given we took so much time already,
it made sense delaying for a release so we would be confident about our technical choice.</p><p>I worked on a proof of concept for the new model and a week later I had filters working on my laptop,
a convinced eric and&mldr;
many months to make it bright and shiny because it was obviously not going to make it into 6.4</p><h2 id=event-reports-and-filter-request>Event reports and filter request</h2><p>The new filters are modeled around the notions of event reports and filter requests.</p><p>During the lifetime of a session,
an SMTP engine will report various events such as the beginning of a new connection,
the negotiation of ciphers during the TLS handshake or even the beginning of an SMTP transaction with MAIL FROM.
These events help the SMTP engine build a state for a session and determine what is acceptable or not from a client at a given time.</p><p>Some filters may not need a state, they may operate on the parameter to a command and that&rsquo;s all.
Other filters however may need to build a state for a session,
not necessarily the same exact and complete state as the SMTP engine,
but a state that makes sense given the work the filter will do.</p><p>The event reports are <em>informative</em> messages,
which a filter may decide to process or not,
and that encompass ALL of the SMTP events a session goes through.
It is possible to replay an entire SMTP session based on these reports.</p><p>The filter requests however are not informative.
A filter will be configured to handle a particular filtering phase and will receive filter requests for that phase,
containing the phase and the parameter to filter,
it will then be REQUIRED to answer the request with an action to take.</p><p>Again,
simple filters may only deal with filter requests,
more complex filters may process the event reports to learn about sessions before dealing with filter requests.</p><h2 id=event-processors>Event processors</h2><p>Event processors are standalone executables which &mldr; process event reports and filter requests in an infinite loop.</p><p>OpenSMTPD executes them at startup and sets up an environment so they behave like traditional Unix-filters:
they read input from stdin and write output to stdout.</p><p>Both event reports and filter requests will consist of single lines,
each consisting of multiple fields separated by a pipe symbol <code>|</code>.
All lines will hold a generic set of fields such as event type and session identifier,
as well as a set of event-specific fields such as an ip address for connection event,
an email address for mail-from event, etc&mldr;</p><p>Event reports will expect no response,
meaning that for a line read on stdin there will be no line written on stdout,
whereas filter requests will expect a response,
meaning that for a line read on stdin there will be one line written to stdout.</p><p>The simplest processor to write is one reading events to log them:</p><div class=highlight><pre tabindex=0 style=color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#282a36;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4><code class=language-sh data-lang=sh><span style=display:flex><span><span style=color:#ff79c6>#! /bin/sh

</span></span></code></pre></div><p>If you have ever parsed OpenSMTPD logs to inject them into an ELK or similar,
you should now be in love with the events reporting feature.</p><p>Filters are not much more complex,
the only difference is that <code>$line</code> needs to be split to extract the session identifier,
and the processor needs to write back its decision.</p><p>The simplest filtering processor to write is one that accepts every filter-request:</p><div class=highlight><pre tabindex=0 style=color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#282a36;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4><code class=language-sh data-lang=sh><span style=display:flex><span><span style=color:#ff79c6>#! /bin/sh

</span></span></code></pre></div><p>Note that while this example shows a synchronous protocol where a filter-request gets an immediate answer,
the implementation does not impose that limitation.
There should be a filter-response for each filter-request,
but they do not need to happen right away and they do not need to happen in the same sequence order.</p><p>Now that you&rsquo;re all sold on this solution, here are the bonus advantages:</p><p>OpenSMTPD only knows that it has to execute the processor and write to its stdin.
There are no dependencies and no limitations to what language a processor is written in,
a postmaster does not have to learn C to write a filter but can effectively hack something fast with a few lines of shell or python.</p><p>The events processors are forked:
they do not share the same memory space as OpenSMTPD,
they do not share the same memory space as each other,
and on systems that provide randomized memory layout they do not even share the same memory layout.
On OpenBSD, each processor could benefit from its own <code>pledge()</code> and its own <code>unveil()</code>.
A compromise of either one does not imply the compromission of the others or of the daemon.</p><p>In addition, they can be executed with different privileges and including chrooted() to a particular directory:</p><pre tabindex=0><code>proc filter1 &#34;/tmp/filter1.sh&#34; user _filter1
proc filter2 &#34;/tmp/filter2.sh&#34; group _filter2
proc filter3 &#34;/tmp/filter3.sh&#34; user _filter3 group gilles
proc filter4 &#34;/filter4&#34; user _filter4 chroot &#34;/tmp&#34;
</code></pre><h2 id=event-proc>Event proc</h2><p>Event processors can receive event reports for each events generated by the SMTP engine (for now).</p><p>This allows two things.
First,
it allows fine-grained reporting to specialized software that can extract metrics,
generate fancy dashboards and such.</p><p>Until now,
people had to try and extract this information from our log files which were meant to be consumed by humans primarily.
The event logs provides all of the useful informations in a format that can be easily parsed by scripts.
Converting these entries to the proper format for injecting in a timeseries database or similar becomes trivial.</p><p>Then,
some filters may be able to work without any context by looking solely at the current command,
but in many cases a decision at a particular phase may be the consequence of decisions at earlier phases,
and filters can consume these event reports to build their own view of the state of sessions.</p><p>Here is a sample of event reports:</p><pre tabindex=0><code>report|smtp-in|link-connect|1541271219|3189ac6874354895|localhost|127.0.0.1:41564|127.0.0.1:25
report|smtp-in|protocol-server|1541271219|3189ac6874354895|220 poolp.org ESMTP OpenSMTPD
report|smtp-in|protocol-client|1541271222|3189ac6874354895|helo localhost
report|smtp-in|protocol-server|1541271222|3189ac6874354895|250 poolp.org Hello localhost [127.0.0.1], pleased to meet you
report|smtp-in|link-disconnect|1541271224|3189ac6874354895
</code></pre><p>And this is how you define an event proc in smtpd.conf:</p><pre tabindex=0><code>proc my_event_proc &#34;/usr/local/bin/script.sh&#34;

report smtp on my_event_proc
</code></pre><p>This gets OpenSMTPD to run the script at startup and to pipe the event reports to its stdin.</p><h2 id=filter-proc>Filter proc</h2><p>Filter processors are very similar to event processors in how they work,
excepted that they are registered for specific filtering phases:</p><pre tabindex=0><code>proc my_filter_proc &#34;/usr/local/bin/script.sh&#34;

# line below can be uncommented if filters needs event reports to build a state
# report smtp on my_filter_proc
filter smtp helo on my_filter_proc
filter smtp ehlo on my_filter_proc
filter smtp mail-from on my_filter_proc
filter smtp rcpt-to on my_filter_proc
</code></pre><p>The filters will receive phase-specific parameters:</p><pre tabindex=0><code>filter-request|smtp-in|ehlo|e68808ff61812a6f|laptop.home|localhost
filter-request|smtp-in|mail-from|e68808ff61812a6f|&lt;gilles@laptop.home&gt;
filter-request|smtp-in|rcpt-to|e68808ff61812a6f|&lt;gilles@laptop.home&gt;
filter-request|smtp-in|ehlo|e688090368c275a3|laptop.home|localhost
filter-request|smtp-in|mail-from|e688090368c275a3|&lt;gilles@laptop.home&gt;
filter-request|smtp-in|rcpt-to|e688090368c275a3|&lt;gilles@laptop.home&gt;
</code></pre><p>To which they will have to reply with a decision:</p><pre tabindex=0><code>filter-response|e68808ff61812a6f|proceed
filter-response|e68808ff61812a6f|rewrite|BLEH
filter-response|e68808ff61812a6f|reject|550 go away
filter-response|e68808ff61812a6f|disconnect|550 go away
</code></pre><p>The only possible decisions are <code>proceed</code>, <code>rewrite</code>, <code>reject</code> or <code>disconnect</code>.</p><h2 id=builtin-filters>Builtin filters</h2><p>Filter proc are very useful when a decision relies on anything else than the parameter to the command being filtered,
when it depends on information gathered from previous events,
or even when it depends on complex logic involving multiple lookups.</p><p>In many cases though,
a decision to filter may rely solely on the current command and a simple table lookup.
For instance,
one may want to reject a HELO hostname that&rsquo;s not part of a table,
or reject a MAIL FROM that matches a regular expression.</p><p>For these cases,
OpenSMTPD provides a small set of builtin filters which are fairly generic to be applied to all phases.</p><pre tabindex=0><code>table helo-reject { &#34;foobar&#34;, &#34;barbaz&#34;, &#34;bazqux&#34; }
table helo-reject-regex { &#34;^f[oO]o[bB]ar$&#34; }

filter smtp helo check-table &lt;helo-reject&gt; reject &#34;550 go away&#34;
filter smtp helo check-regex &#34;^go\-away$&#34; reject &#34;550 go away&#34;
filter smtp helo check-regex &lt;helo-reject-regex&gt; reject &#34;550 go away&#34;
</code></pre><p>We will also implement some very limited additional phase-specific builtin filters that cover common use-cases.
OpenSMTPD performs a reverse DNS lookup on connect,
both connect and helo/ehlo filter phases commonly check reverse DNS,
so we already provided a <code>check-rdns</code> for these phases:</p><pre tabindex=0><code>filter smtp connect check-rdns reject &#34;550 you need a reverse DNS&#34;
filter smtp ehlo check-rdns reject &#34;550 your HELO hostname and rDNS mismatch&#34;
</code></pre><p>There shouldn&rsquo;t be many builtin filters,
we don&rsquo;t expect more than a handful of them,
but they do exist so there&rsquo;s that ;-)</p><h2 id=what-next->What next ?</h2><p>This code has been committed to OpenBSD and will be available in OpenSMTPD 6.5.0,
which should happen sometime around April 2019.</p><p>I haven&rsquo;t documented anything yet because both configuration grammar and protocol are still going through lots of changes,
I would strongly suggest against playing with event reports and filter procs before March,
unless you&rsquo;re a developer and happy with having to make changes to your code every few days.</p><p>The only part that I have not committed yet is the filtering of DATA,
which still requires a bit of work but will be working and committed sometime in November.</p><p>Once I have this part done,
I&rsquo;ll implement a few filters for the use-cases I have such as filter-spf and filter-rspamd,
then it will be ok as far as I&rsquo;m concerned.</p><p>My main work for the release cycle to come is finishing and polishing filters,
fixing the portable layer which has grown a monster,
and ultimately doing a full release cycle of&mldr;
cosmethic cleanup so code is pleasing to read ;-)</p><hr><p>Comments: <a href=https://github.com/poolpOrg/poolp.org/discussions/95 target=_blank rel=noopener>https://github.com/poolpOrg/poolp.org/discussions/95</a></p><script src=https://giscus.app/client.js data-repo=poolpOrg/poolp.org data-repo-id="MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMjYxODk2MjA=" data-category=Articles data-category-id=DIC_kwDOB4WANM4B-Zf1 data-mapping=og:title data-strict=0 data-reactions-enabled=1 data-emit-metadata=1 data-input-position=top data-theme=light data-lang=en data-loading=lazy crossorigin=anonymous async></script></article></div></div><script type=text/javascript src=/main.js defer></script></body></html>
