I worked on converting OpenSMTPD to the libtls API so that I could simplify TLS support and bring new features that I didn&rsquo;t want to implement with the libssl API.</p><p>The diff was never merged into OpenBSD and <strong>ended up rotting in a private branch</strong>.
This was unfortunate because I spent time making this work for portable too,
building an OpenSSL-enabled libtls that would allow distributions not shipping LibreSSL to still benefit from this TLS simplification.</p><p>Eric Faurot (eric@) has recently picked up my work and pushed it even further,
<strong>managing to make OpenSMTPD completely libssl-agnostic while I still needed bits for the privsep crypto engines</strong>.
He <a href="https://marc.info/?l=openbsd-tech&m=161173678114145&w=2">submitted a diff to tech@</a> which is pending review.
Once his diff gets committed in OpenBSD,
I&rsquo;ll rework the portable code to make it work again so this benefits users on other systems.</p><p>I&rsquo;ve been suggested by eric@ and a tech@ reader to look at <a href=https://git.causal.agency/libretls/about/>libretls</a>.
The problem is that libretls is not yet available in the package repositories of all distributions supported by OpenSMTPD,
and eric@ also brought changes in LibreSSL that libretls will need to catch up with before I can rely on it.
I think the best approach is to rely on the standalone code I already wrote and which is shipped with OpenSMTPD,
then once libretls is widely available I can reassess the situation.</p><h1 id=libtls-related-features>libtls-related features</h1><p>I have three features related to the libtls change that are already written,
rotting in their own branches,
and that I will submit once the TLS diff is committed.
They make it possible to <strong>configure the ciphers, curves and TLS versions supported for each listeners</strong>.</p><p>The rationale behind this is that some setups require stronger (or specific) crypto constraints for specific networks.
This change would allow declaring that a specific interface requires use of a different set of ciphers or TLS version,
and allow for example to have an interface with the default settings for Internet and one with extra-paranoid settings for a specific MX.</p><p>I also had started working on other features,
like <strong>certificates fingerprinting or OCSP stapling</strong>,
but I stopped as I didn&rsquo;t want to have too much code building upon an uncommitted diff.</p><p>I&rsquo;ll resume working on these once eric@ commits the libtls conversion.</p><h1 id=smtpd8-now-binds-unix-domain-sockets><code>smtpd(8)</code> now binds UNIX-domain sockets</h1><p>At the exception of the local enqueuer,
OpenSMTPD <strong>only supports SMTP sessions over network connections</strong>.
This shows in the configuration file as it is only possible to use <code>listen</code> directives with a network interface parameter&mldr;
or with the <code>socket</code> keyword which is handled as a <strong>special case</strong> for the local enqueuer.</p><p>When the daemon starts,
it creates a UNIX-domain socket to use as its <strong>control socket</strong> for the <code>smtpctl(8)</code> utility.
This was initially meant to accept control requests from root to interact with <code>smtpd(8)</code> at runtime,
but later came the need for local enqueueing and the control socket was used for that purpose too.</p><p>A special &ldquo;enqueue&rdquo; control command was implemented in <code>smtpd(8)</code>.
That command allows <code>smtpctl(8)</code> to request from <code>smtpd(8)</code> that it establishes an internal SMTP session and returns the file descriptor.
The <code>smtpctl(8)</code> utility then uses that descriptor to pretend that the socket was actually connected directly to the SMTP server,
and it <strong>toggles into an enqueue mode</strong> where it operates as an SMTP client.</p><p>This has three side-effects:</p><p>Because <strong>everyone</strong> is supposed to be able to enqueue a local mail,
the control socket cannot have strict permissions and <strong>has to be world-writeable</strong>.
Since it is also used for privileged control commands,
the daemon needs to <strong>explicitly</strong> check that the client is only allowed to access the enqueue mode if the user is not privileged:</p><div class=highlight><pre tabindex=0 class=chroma><code class=language-sh data-lang=sh><span class=line><span class=cl>$ ls -l /var/run/smtpd.sock                                                
</span></span><span class=line><span class=cl>srw-rw-rw-  <span class=m>1</span> root  wheel  <span class=m>0</span> Dec <span class=m>28</span> 06:38 /var/run/smtpd.sock
</span></span><span class=line><span class=cl>$ smtpctl show queue
</span></span><span class=line><span class=cl>smtpctl: need root privileges
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>Then,
because there is some magic involved to request the file descriptor and toggle in enqueue mode,
the control socket is not <em>really</em> connected directly to the SMTP server.
It is not possible to connect to it with <code>netcat</code> and talk SMTP as it expects a control command sent with the <code>imsg(3)</code> framework.
The server will just ignore the client as it doesn&rsquo;t speak its protocol,
and the connection must be established by <code>smtpctl(8)</code> requesting the enqueue mode (or a clone that knows how to do so):</p><div class=highlight><pre tabindex=0 class=chroma><code class=language-sh data-lang=sh><span class=line><span class=cl>$ nc -U /var/run/smtpd.sock  
</span></span><span class=line><span class=cl>HELO ??????
</span></span><span class=line><span class=cl>^C
</span></span><span class=line><span class=cl>$
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>Finally,
users expect to be able to enqueue mail even if the daemon is not available.
This requires the local enqueuer to support an <strong>offline queue</strong>,
which itself relies on having an executable <strong>setgid</strong> to the same group as the offline directory.
Because <code>smtpctl(8)</code> is used for both control and enqueuing,
it ends up having the setgid bit itself:</p><div class=highlight><pre tabindex=0 class=chroma><code class=language-sh data-lang=sh><span class=line><span class=cl>-r-xr-sr-x  <span class=m>1</span> root  _smtpq  <span class=m>217696</span> Dec <span class=m>23</span> 06:42 /usr/sbin/smtpctl
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>A year ago,
I told eric@ that I believed this was a poor decision made in the early days.
Both the control and the enqueuing code could be made simpler and stricter if they were split apart.</p><p>If local enqueuing had its own dedicated socket which established a connection to an SMTP session,
then <strong>any</strong> SMTP client that knew how to connect to a UNIX-domain socket could be used as the local enqueuer.
OpenSMTPD even ships with one&mldr; <code>smtp(1)</code>.</p><p>This would simplify <code>smtpctl(8)</code> as it would no longer need an enqueue mode and a builtin SMTP client.
It would also simplify <code>smtpd(8)</code> as it would no longer need to implement the internal SMTP session and fd passing logic,
but would also no longer need to check if a user can or can&rsquo;t run a command: if it&rsquo;s not root, it can&rsquo;t.
The control socket and <code>smtpctl(8)</code> could both be restricted to root as they would only be used for control requests.</p><p>If you don&rsquo;t see the benefit behind this,
many years ago there were two bugs that allowed local users to crash <code>smtpd(8)</code> from <code>smtpctl(8)</code>.
One affected the control command counter,
which a user could not have messed up with <strong>if control commands were restricted to root</strong>,
and the other affected the fd passing for the enqueue mode,
which would <strong>not even exist</strong> if enqueuing had its own dedicated socket instead of being a control command.</p><p>This sounds nice but converting local enqueuing to use its own dedicated UNIX-domain socket is trickier than it seems.
The technical aspect is simple,
you just bind a UNIX-domain socket instead of a TCP socket,
but it raises a lot of other questions regarding the behavior of the daemon.
I will discuss that in a future post as this is still being sorted out.</p><p>What could be done right now and that wouldn&rsquo;t raise questions was to teach <code>smtpd(8)</code> how to bind a UNIX-domain listener.
It makes it possible to declare listeners that have UNIX-domain sockets as their endpoints and which plain SMTP clients can connect to:</p><pre tabindex=0><code>$ cat /etc/mail/smtpd.conf |grep listen
listen on socket &#34;/tmp/foobar.sock&#34;
listen on socket &#34;/tmp/barbaz.sock&#34;
$ nc -U /tmp/foobar.sock
220 debug.poolp.org ESMTP OpenSMTPD
^C
$ printf &#34;subject: test\n\ntest&#34; | smtp -s /tmp/barbaz.sock gilles@poolp.org 
gilles@poolp.org: EOM: 250 2.0.0 593c830c Message accepted for delivery
$ 
</code></pre><p>It doesn&rsquo;t solve the local enqueuer issues as it still uses the control socket,
but it allows regular SMTP clients to submit mail over a UNIX-domain socket without relying on control commands.
Moving forward in this direction,
a new local enqueuer can be written that doesn&rsquo;t rely on the enqueue control command,
which ultimately leads to enqueuing being removed from <code>smtpctl(8)</code> and more restrictive permissions on the control socket.</p><p>I already showed the diff to eric@ but I will send it to OpenBSD next week.</p><h1 id=smtp1-now-talks-unix-domain-socket><code>smtp(1)</code> now talks Unix-domain socket</h1><p>Following the UNIX-domain sockets listeners idea,
I thought it would be nice to do the client side too.</p><p>A while back,
eric@ wrote <code>smtp(1)</code> which is a simple utility to submit mail to SMTP servers on the command line:</p><div class=highlight><pre tabindex=0 class=chroma><code class=language-sh data-lang=sh><span class=line><span class=cl>$ cat<span class=s>&lt;&lt;EOF | smtp -s localhost gilles@poolp.org

</span></span></code></pre></div><p>The <code>smtp(1)</code> client didn&rsquo;t know how to connect to a UNIX-domain socket so I fixed that:</p><div class=highlight><pre tabindex=0 class=chroma><code class=language-sh data-lang=sh><span class=line><span class=cl>$ cat<span class=s>&lt;&lt;EOF | smtp -s /tmp/smtpd.sock gilles@poolp.org

</span></span><span class=line><span class=cl>$
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>This allowed me to test my diff on the server side,
but it also made me realize that it could be used as the base for a new local enqueuer outside of <code>smtpctl(8)</code>.</p><p>The current local enqueuer is based on the <strong>femail</strong> MUA,
which was kind of hacked here and there to fit in <code>smtpctl(8)</code> and work with its enqueue mode.
It reads the mail from its standard input,
does some <strong>sanitizing and crafting</strong>,
then submits it using the SMTP protocol on a file descriptor which points to an SMTP session.</p><p>In a world where local enqueuing doesn&rsquo;t require <code>smtpctl(8)</code> entering a special enqueue mode,
it would be fairly easy to use <code>smtp(1)</code> as a base to write a new enqueuer.
It already reads mail from standard input,
it already knows how to speak SMTP and with my diff it knows how to connect to a UNIX-domain socket.
All that would be missing is adding the sanitizing and crafting bits which we already have.</p><p>I also already showed the diff to eric@ and will send it to OpenBSD next week with the listeners one.</p><h1 id=noosmtpd-not-openbsds-opensmtpd>nooSMTPD: Not OpenBSD&rsquo;s OpenSMTPD</h1><p>I didn&rsquo;t want to talk about this yet but since people have spotted the repository and are making assumptions,
I need to explain what that is.</p><p>In December, I started working on an MTA.
It is based on OpenSMTPD,
but it takes a <strong>different direction</strong> and has <strong>different goals</strong>.</p><p>OpenSMTPD is a <strong>general purpose MTA</strong>,
written primarily for OpenBSD,
which needs to fit the base system and care about <strong>legacy</strong> and how changes affect the user base.</p><p>nooSMTPD doesn&rsquo;t have these constraints.
I&rsquo;m writing it <strong>primarily for myself</strong> and will happily break legacy behaviors and change the configuration file every two months if it makes things easier for me.
I intend to support some <strong>advanced features</strong> found in commercial MTA and that are unlikely to be accepted in OpenBSD because&mldr;
OpenSMTPD is a general purpose MTA.</p><p>OpenSMTPD benefits from the work I do there as I share all diffs,
but in some cases they are unsuitable for OpenBSD and this is where things diverge between the two,
it will contain diffs that don&rsquo;t make it into OpenSMTPD.</p><p>I&rsquo;ll write about it more in details in the future,
I just wanted to clarify that this isn&rsquo;t the fork some people think it is.
I have exchanged multiple diffs with eric@, millert@, martijn@ and even tech@ since December,
and I continue to talk about OpenSMTPD changes with eric@ every week.</p><p>I just have ideas for a different project :-)</p><h1 id=breaking-changes-in-noosmtpd>breaking changes in nooSMTPD</h1><p>I have <strong>killed the <code>dead.letter</code></strong> feature which allows OpenSMTPD to save a copy of a mail when it fails to submit it to the enqueuer.
Modern MUA do not make use of it,
it is solely used by legacy MUA,
and I always thought this was not the job of the MTA to handle it.
It was also a vector of attack in the past.</p><p>I have <strong>killed delivery to the <code>root</code> user</strong> for all mail delivery agents,
the only way <code>root</code> can receive a mail is through an alias to an unprivileged account.</p><p>I have merged all of the diffs from <a href=https://poolp.org/posts/2020-12-24/december-2020-opensmtpd-6.8.0p1-released-fixed-several-bugs-proposed-several-diffs-book-is-on-github/>last month</a>,

For example,
the following construct was found in multiple places,
