This post won't need a TL;DR as I'll keep it short. Generalized anxiety disorder and alexithymia. Late 2018, I&rsquo;ve been diagnosed with generalized anxiety disorder and alexithymia a couple weeks apart.
The anxiety disorder didn&rsquo;t really come as a surprise as I know very well the traumatic experience that led to the disorder. It&rsquo;ll still take a lot of hours of hypnosis to continue cleaning up trauma after trauma, but taking care of it and releasing some of the traumas has improved considerably my anxiety.</div></a><a class="article block px-3 py-4 hover:bg-slate-200 dark:hover:bg-slate-700" href=/posts/2018-12-21/opensmtpd-now-supports-regex-in-match-rules/><h3 class="text-lg font-semibold mb-0.5">OpenSMTPD now supports regex in match rules</h3><div class="text-sm text-slate-500 dark:text-slate-400 line-clamp-2">TL;DR: regex table lookups were introduced for builtin filters. After a few weeks of working solely on filters, I wanted to work on something else. Using the same mechanism, all match criterias using tables can support regex. K_REGEX lookups The table mechanism is used within OpenSMTPD to perform all kinds of lookups.
Recently, while working on builtin filters, I introduced the K_REGEX lookup type allowing tables to serve regex(3) patterns.</div></a><a class="article block px-3 py-4 hover:bg-slate-200 dark:hover:bg-slate-700" href=/posts/2018-12-19/more-on-opensmtpd-filters/><h3 class="text-lg font-semibold mb-0.5">more on OpenSMTPD filters</h3><div class="text-sm text-slate-500 dark:text-slate-400 line-clamp-2">TL;DR: Not this time, pal/gal, I took hours writing this post, you'll take a few minutes reading it all. Oh, and merry X-mas :-* A bit of short-sighted history The filtering feature has been introduced only recently in OpenSMTPD, first presented on this blog a month ago.
I had a working proof-of-concept running on my laptop and my plan was to start bringing the code to the OpenBSD tree, small chunks by small chunks, through a serie of diffs.</div></a><a class="article block px-3 py-4 hover:bg-slate-200 dark:hover:bg-slate-700" href=/posts/2018-12-06/opensmtpd-proc-filters-fc-rdns/><h3 class="text-lg font-semibold mb-0.5">OpenSMTPD proc filters & fc-rDNS</h3><div class="text-sm text-slate-500 dark:text-slate-400 line-clamp-2">TL;DR: I *FINALFUCKINGLY* commited proc filters support allowing full filtering in OpenSMTPD. eric@ implemented fc-rDNS lookups. fc-rDNS fc-rDNS, or forward-confirmed reverse DNS, consists in performing a reverse DNS lookup to determine the hostname associated to an IP address&mldr; then performing a DNS lookup on that hostname to check if it resolves back to the IP address.
On my request, eric@ implemented fc-rDNS lookups in our SMTP engine, causing OpenSMTPD to perform the double lookup upon clients connections.</div></a><a class="article block px-3 py-4 hover:bg-slate-200 dark:hover:bg-slate-700" href=/posts/2018-11-09/opensmtpd-reporting-update/><h3 class="text-lg font-semibold mb-0.5">OpenSMTPD reporting update</h3><div class="text-sm text-slate-500 dark:text-slate-400 line-clamp-2">TL;DR: The reporting mechanism has been described shortly in my previous article about both reporting and filters. Let's focus a bit more on the reporting bits this time. The format is improving further and has extended to outgoing trafic reporting. Reporting In previous article, I described the events reporting mechanism that has been introduced in the development branch of OpenSMTPD.
To sum it up, you could now write an event processor as simple as a shell script reading its stdin on a loop:</div></a><a class="article block px-3 py-4 hover:bg-slate-200 dark:hover:bg-slate-700" href=/posts/2018-11-03/opensmtpd-released-and-upcoming-filters-preview/><h3 class="text-lg font-semibold mb-0.5">OpenSMTPD released and upcoming filters preview</h3><div class="text-sm text-slate-500 dark:text-slate-400 line-clamp-2">TL;DR: Filters have been a (the most ?) long awaited feature in OpenSMTPD.

OpenSMTPD 6.4.0 was released ! We have released OpenSMTPD 6.4.0 last week without filters.
I won&rsquo;t expand on the features in the 6.</div></a><a class="article block px-3 py-4 hover:bg-slate-200 dark:hover:bg-slate-700" href=/posts/2018-05-21/switching-to-opensmtpd-new-config/><h3 class="text-lg font-semibold mb-0.5">switching to OpenSMTPD new config</h3><div class="text-sm text-slate-500 dark:text-slate-400 line-clamp-2">TL;DR: Switching to new config is not too hard and can be done in minutes. The new config is also a new queue that is not backwards compatible. The easiest way is to flush the mail queue before switching. We came up with a solution to help maintainers of more complex setups. Switching from old config to new config The new OpenSMTPD configuration grammar is slightly different from the current one, rules are no longer stated as single lines, but the conversion from previous ruleset to new ruleset isn&rsquo;t that hard.</div></a><a class="article block px-3 py-4 hover:bg-slate-200 dark:hover:bg-slate-700" href=/posts/2018-04-30/opensmtpd-new-config/><h3 class="text-lg font-semibold mb-0.5">OpenSMTPD new config</h3><div class="text-sm text-slate-500 dark:text-slate-400 line-clamp-2">TL;DR: OpenBSD #p2k18 hackathon took place at Epitech in Nantes. I was organizing the hackathon but managed to make progress on OpenSMTPD. As mentionned at EuroBSDCon the one-line per rule config format was a design error. A new configuration grammar is almost ready and the underlying structures are simplified. Refactor removes ~750 lines of code and solves _many_ issues that were side-effects of the design error. New features are going to be unlocked thanks to this.</div></a><a class="article block px-3 py-4 hover:bg-slate-200 dark:hover:bg-slate-700" href=/posts/2018-01-29/install-openbsd-on-dedibox-with-full-disk-encryption/><h3 class="text-lg font-semibold mb-0.5">Install OpenBSD on dedibox with full-disk encryption</h3><div class="text-sm text-slate-500 dark:text-slate-400 line-clamp-2">TL;DR: I run several "dedibox" servers at online.net, all powered by OpenBSD.

Aaron Poffenberger wrote a shell-based `spf_fetch` utility. I wrote a C-based `spfwalk` utility that's `pledge()`-ed. The `spfwalk` utility got merged to `smtpctl`. What&rsquo;s SPF in a few words SPF is the Sender Policy Framework, a standard to verify the domain name of an e-mail sender.
Long story short, the SMTP protocol does not come with a way to authenticate a domain and, during an SMTP session, nothing really prevents a sender from pretending to come from any domain:</div></a><a class="article block px-3 py-4 hover:bg-slate-200 dark:hover:bg-slate-700" href=/posts/2018-01-08/news-from-the-front/><h3 class="text-lg font-semibold mb-0.5">News from the front !</h3><div class="text-sm text-slate-500 dark:text-slate-400 line-clamp-2">TL;DR: Came very close to a burn out late 2016, had to quit former employer.

Unlike most of our releases, it comes out with almost no new feature.
The changelog fits in less than 10 lines as follows:
- new fork+reexec model so each process has its own randomized memory space - logging format has been reworked - a "multi-line response" bug in the LMTP delivery backend has been fixed - connections concurrency limits have been bumped - artificial delaying in remote sessions have been reduced - dhparams option has been removed - dhe option has been added, supporting auto and legacy modes - smtp engine has been simplified - various cosmethic changes, code cleanup and documentation improvement Seems like a very productive slacking, however some of these changes turn out to be very interesting in terms of code simplification and security.</div></a><a class="article block px-3 py-4 hover:bg-slate-200 dark:hover:bg-slate-700" href=/posts/2015-12-22/home-sweet-home/><h3 class="text-lg font-semibold mb-0.5">Home, sweet home</h3><div class="text-sm text-slate-500 dark:text-slate-400 line-clamp-2">TL;DR: OpenSMTPD on github no longer diverges from OpenBSD. Since last episode Sometime this year, we released OpenSMTPD 5.7.1 which was the first version that shipped with the long-awaited experimental filters support. The result of over a year and a half of very very deep refactor in our IO layer and the addition of a very elegant but also very tricky new API.
This refactor took place outside the OpenBSD tree because it required breaking a lot of code for extended period of times, which spanned over 3 OpenBSD releases.</div></a><a class="article block px-3 py-4 hover:bg-slate-200 dark:hover:bg-slate-700" href=/posts/2014-12-12/the-state-of-filters/><h3 class="text-lg font-semibold mb-0.5">The state of filters</h3><div class="text-sm text-slate-500 dark:text-slate-400 line-clamp-2">TL;DR: yeeeees, filters are coming. don't believe us ? here's an example. be patient. On my death bed On my death bed, when my life flashes before my eyes and I start recalling what people have told me during my (hopefully long) lifetime, these sentences will single out:
&ldquo;When will OpenSMTPD support filters ? I need it.&rdquo;
Not that it carries a philosophical meaning that will have taken me a lifetime of thinking, but because for the last three years I have been hearing this every time I met someone IRL and discussed OpenSMTPD, I have read it on our Github issues tracker, on GTalk, on IRC, on Twitter, on Facebook, on random forums, and just this week three times in my mailbox.</div></a><a class="article block px-3 py-4 hover:bg-slate-200 dark:hover:bg-slate-700" href=/posts/2014-12-10/some-opensmtpd-overview-part-3/><h3 class="text-lg font-semibold mb-0.5">Some OpenSMTPD overview, part 3</h3><div class="text-sm text-slate-500 dark:text-slate-400 line-clamp-2">EHLO,
This is the third post of a series about OpenSMTPD improvements that have taken place since this summer.
Content altering For a long time, we have developed OpenSMTPD with a strict rule that the daemon should not alter DATA (as in the DATA SMTP phase) in any way.
The rationale was that by enforcing that rule, the message writing was simplified as the smtp process would simply read data from a client and write it, without any post-processing, to a file descriptor.</div></a><a class="article block px-3 py-4 hover:bg-slate-200 dark:hover:bg-slate-700" href=/posts/2014-12-01/some-opensmtpd-overview-part-2/><h3 class="text-lg font-semibold mb-0.5">Some OpenSMTPD overview, part 2</h3><div class="text-sm text-slate-500 dark:text-slate-400 line-clamp-2">Why we killed the MFA (filter) process For as long as I can remember, a process called MFA was created by OpenSMTPD at start time.
MFA stood for &ldquo;Mail Filter Agent&rdquo; and the goal of that process was initially to take care of all filtering tasks ranging from filtering senders based on the ruleset matching to starting and controlling filters.
As time passed by, we figured the lookup process was better suited for ruleset matching and the MFA process became mostly idle, we renamed it to &ldquo;filter&rdquo; process since the only thing it had to do was take care of starting filters and making sure they had the proper environment.</div></a><a class="article block px-3 py-4 hover:bg-slate-200 dark:hover:bg-slate-700" href=/posts/2014-11-26/some-opensmtpd-overview-part-1/><h3 class="text-lg font-semibold mb-0.5">Some OpenSMTPD overview, part 1</h3><div class="text-sm text-slate-500 dark:text-slate-400 line-clamp-2">EHLO world ! Yesterday I thought I&rsquo;d write a first OpenSMTPD-related post to sum up the changes that have happened since this summer but it turned out to be painful as they amount to quite a lot. Instead, I think a better strategy is to split this into a serie of smaller posts focused on the specific changes ;-)
So, in June I have organized a mini hackathon at my brand new place and invited some of the French Connection at home.</div></a><a class="article block px-3 py-4 hover:bg-slate-200 dark:hover:bg-slate-700" href=/posts/2014-11-24/what-the-fsck-did-just-happen/><h3 class="text-lg font-semibold mb-0.5">what the fsck did just happen</h3><div class="text-sm text-slate-500 dark:text-slate-400 line-clamp-2">Good news everyone !

OpenSMTPD has been in use at poolp.org since 2008 and these last five years have seen a considerable amount of work. At various times we have been contemplating a release then delaying to add that one thing that seemed essential.</div></a><a class="article block px-3 py-4 hover:bg-slate-200 dark:hover:bg-slate-700" href=/posts/2013-02-02/opensmtpd-minor-fixes--preparing-release/><h3 class="text-lg font-semibold mb-0.5">OpenSMTPD: minor fixes + preparing release</h3><div class="text-sm text-slate-500 dark:text-slate-400 line-clamp-2">OHAI,
We had planned to slow down a bit to prepare for release: no more feature, no more invasive changes until we tag something out of which we can publish a release. I then discussed with Bret Lambert (blambert@) and he asked me if we used some kind of code scanner to detect defects in our code.
We do use the clang static analyzer every now and then, the last time being a couple week ago, and we spend a few minutes cleaning up the defects we believe to be real issues.</div></a><a class="article block px-3 py-4 hover:bg-slate-200 dark:hover:bg-slate-700" href=/posts/2013-01-25/opensmtpd-gentlemen-fasten-your-seatbelt/><h3 class="text-lg font-semibold mb-0.5">OpenSMTPD: gentlemen, fasten your seatbelt</h3><div class="text-sm text-slate-500 dark:text-slate-400 line-clamp-2">OHAI,
Lately we have stabilized and decided that we&rsquo;re okay with the features we have for our first release, this time for good, so we focused on making sure that we didn&rsquo;t introduce regressions and that we were rock solid.
We stressed incoming and outgoing path and found areas of improvements. This will be a long-standing task, but we have already improved memory usage considerably under high-load, we&rsquo;re pretty happy with the result.</div></a><a class="article block px-3 py-4 hover:bg-slate-200 dark:hover:bg-slate-700" href=/posts/2013-01-18/opensmtpd-stress-and-features/><h3 class="text-lg font-semibold mb-0.5">OpenSMTPD: stress and features</h3><div class="text-sm text-slate-500 dark:text-slate-400 line-clamp-2">&lt;p>Hey,&lt;/p> I wanted to publish something last Friday but I unfortunately got my hands on a copy of Super Nintendo's Zelda which led to an instant loss of motivation.
Here's a quick summary of what happened recently in OpenSMTPD-land, it's not an exhaustive description and to be honest I'm keeping a lot of information private at this point and probably until release ;-)
A snapshot should be published tomorrow.

I know I should have posted a &ldquo;Happy New Year&rdquo; note earlier but you know how it is: new year eve&rsquo;s aftermath, days to recover, work resumes, mood slacks, bleh.
Anyway, today&rsquo;s note is simply about that: wishing you and me an awesome year 2013 and hoping you will not turn it into a fucking mess. After all, you&rsquo;re in charge so we know who to blame ;-)
As far as I&rsquo;m concerned, year 2012 wasn&rsquo;t &ldquo;great&rdquo;, it was not the absolute suck either, it was even quite decent.</div></a><a class="article block px-3 py-4 hover:bg-slate-200 dark:hover:bg-slate-700" href=/posts/2012-12-28/opensmtpd-ssl-relay-stuff/><h3 class="text-lg font-semibold mb-0.5">OpenSMTPD: SSL & relay stuff</h3><div class="text-sm text-slate-500 dark:text-slate-400 line-clamp-2">OHAI,
I was unable to write a story last week as my desk broke into pieces for no apparent reason but my foot hitting it accidentally.
I still don&rsquo;t have a desk so I will make this short by not telling about the queue profiling and SQL log conversion I wrote, and not even writing about the filter work done by Eric, he&rsquo;ll write about it if he wants to or I&rsquo;ll do that next time.</div></a><a class="article block px-3 py-4 hover:bg-slate-200 dark:hover:bg-slate-700" href=/posts/2012-12-14/opensmtpd-ldap-support-selectable-source-dkim-and-goodies/><h3 class="text-lg font-semibold mb-0.5">OpenSMTPD: LDAP support, selectable source, DKIM and Goodies</h3><div class="text-sm text-slate-500 dark:text-slate-400 line-clamp-2">&lt;p>OHAI,&lt;/p> This week has been crazy, my brain melted a little as I worked on filters, it melted a little as I worked on LDAP and it melted a little more as I tried to trick Eric into working on filters with me (yes, that actually worked :-).
Anyway, as usual, this is just going to be a summary of what we did as tons of little stuff have been committed here and there.</div></a><a class="article block px-3 py-4 hover:bg-slate-200 dark:hover:bg-slate-700" href=/posts/2012-12-07/opensmtpd-fully-virtual-setups-updated-dns-mta-code-sqlite-support/><h3 class="text-lg font-semibold mb-0.5">OpenSMTPD: fully virtual setups, updated DNS & MTA code, SQLite support</h3><div class="text-sm text-slate-500 dark:text-slate-400 line-clamp-2">OHAI,
This week I had intended to work on filters. After 3 days of pain and swearing, even though it did move forward, I finally decided to step back for a few days and work on something else to preserve my sanity.
As you may have guessed, this week has not been too productive&mldr; Oh wait, yes it has ! It&rsquo;s actually been incredibly productive :-)
Just as usual, I will only write a summary for this week, the complete changelog can be retrieved from our mirror on Github.</div></a><a class="article block px-3 py-4 hover:bg-slate-200 dark:hover:bg-slate-700" href=/posts/2012-11-30/opensmtpd-more-features-more-cleanup-more-more/><h3 class="text-lg font-semibold mb-0.5">OpenSMTPD: more features, more cleanup, more more</h3><div class="text-sm text-slate-500 dark:text-slate-400 line-clamp-2">OHAI,
First of all, on a completely unrelated note, I&rsquo;d like to emphasize that this blog post is being written from my text editor launched by a little shell and pushed to poolp using the Ocean API. I can be web2.0 from console and emacs, and that&rsquo;s definitely worth a mention ;-)
As has become a habit, a lot of work has been poured in OpenSMTPD this week, here is an incomplete summary of the most notable changes.</div></a><a class="article block px-3 py-4 hover:bg-slate-200 dark:hover:bg-slate-700" href=/posts/2012-11-17/news-from-the-front/><h3 class="text-lg font-semibold mb-0.5">News from the front</h3><div class="text-sm text-slate-500 dark:text-slate-400 line-clamp-2">Almost a month since my last post&mldr; I know, I know.
So I left my position at Scality two weeks ago. I had been there for a year and a half working on a very interesting and tricky project. I will miss my colleagues and the discussions we had on all kinds of topic, I hope them the best future and that we will be able to share beers again ;-)</div></a><a class="article block px-3 py-4 hover:bg-slate-200 dark:hover:bg-slate-700" href=/posts/2012-08-31/opensmtpd-crypto/compress-fixes-and-import-initial-stab-at-ldap/><h3 class="text-lg font-semibold mb-0.5">OpenSMTPD: crypto/compress fixes and import initial stab at LDAP</h3><div class="text-sm text-slate-500 dark:text-slate-400 line-clamp-2">The crypto backend that has been committed a couple days ago started a little discussion and it was decided to switch the default cipher from Blowfish to AES-128 and make it a default.
Encryption can now be enabled as simply as:
queue encryption key &ldquo;foobar&rdquo;
That being said, Charles cleaned up a bit the compression code to make it use FILE* instead of file descriptors. This allows us to ensure we don&rsquo;t have to deal with any buffering and interruption handling code.</div></a><a class="article block px-3 py-4 hover:bg-slate-200 dark:hover:bg-slate-700" href=/posts/2012-08-29/opensmtpd-crypto_backend-and-encrypted-queue/><h3 class="text-lg font-semibold mb-0.5">OpenSMTPD: crypto_backend and encrypted queue</h3><div class="text-sm text-slate-500 dark:text-slate-400 line-clamp-2">A few days ago, Charles committed the compress_backend API which allowed transparent deflation/inflation of envelopes and messages as they hit the queue.
The compression code is executed before the queue_backend gets the data so that any queue_backend can benefit transparently from compression without having to add any code to handle it. Due to our design, this also means that if the queue_backend stores envelopes and messages remotely, then the compression will take place before sending and after fetching, the remote end only ever sees compressed data.</div></a><a class="article block px-3 py-4 hover:bg-slate-200 dark:hover:bg-slate-700" href=/posts/2012-08-26/opensmtpd-i-have-no-idea-for-that-title-sorry/><h3 class="text-lg font-semibold mb-0.5">OpenSMTPD: I have no idea for that title, sorry</h3><div class="text-sm text-slate-500 dark:text-slate-400 line-clamp-2">Howdie,
Eric and I had planned a loooooong time ago to have a hackathon this week-end. However, some asshole piece of shit ran into my car while it was parked, made it unable to take the road and flee without leaving a note. Long story made short, I had to be at the repair shop this week-end to be able to get my car before end of September.
We did get our hackathon though and while it was probably much less productive than if we had met in the same room, it was still very very interesting with tons of improvements and many great features written :-p</div></a><a class="article block px-3 py-4 hover:bg-slate-200 dark:hover:bg-slate-700" href=/posts/2012-08-21/opensmtpd-plenty-of-news/><h3 class="text-lg font-semibold mb-0.5">OpenSMTPD: plenty of news</h3><div class="text-sm text-slate-500 dark:text-slate-400 line-clamp-2">It&rsquo;s been over a month since my last post but I have an excuse: I was super busy, then I was super on vacation &mldr; but I&rsquo;m back again ;-)
So my life was pretty intense these last few weeks, both professionnally and on the opensource front. I&rsquo;ll explain later, for now let&rsquo;s just focus on the OpenSMTPD goodies.
OpenSMTPD portable to a new system First of all, I&rsquo;d like to stress out that Rune Lynge and Charles Longeau did an amazing job at porting OpenSMTPD to yet another system &mldr; MacOSX.</div></a><a class="article block px-3 py-4 hover:bg-slate-200 dark:hover:bg-slate-700" href=/posts/2012-07-15/g2k12-openbsd-hackathon-part-ii/><h3 class="text-lg font-semibold mb-0.5">g2k12: OpenBSD hackathon - part II</h3><div class="text-sm text-slate-500 dark:text-slate-400 line-clamp-2">Yesterday, I came back from Budapest and was too tired to write anything, but here&rsquo;s a quick summary of all the features that have been implemented with regard to OpenSMTPD by Eric, Charles and I.
First of all, Eric [eric@] has moved ASR, his asynchronous resolver, to OpenBSD&rsquo;s libc. This is a huge step forward that will allow OpenSMTPD to contain less code, while providing a better coverage of the resolver code.</div></a><a class="article block px-3 py-4 hover:bg-slate-200 dark:hover:bg-slate-700" href=/posts/2012-07-09/g2k12-openbsd-hackathon/><h3 class="text-lg font-semibold mb-0.5">g2k12: OpenBSD hackathon</h3><div class="text-sm text-slate-500 dark:text-slate-400 line-clamp-2">Yesterday, after nearly missing my plane by 5 minutes, I finally managed to make it to Budapest for g2k12, the OpenBSD general hackathon.
While this is not my first hackathon, this is the first general one with many hackers working on all kinds of subsystems ranging from ports to network and kernel. It&rsquo;s fun to see many people focused on improving different areas which you use daily, sometimes without even noticing, and doing it with as much fun as you are having fixing your own area ;-)</div></a><a class="article block px-3 py-4 hover:bg-slate-200 dark:hover:bg-slate-700" href=/posts/2012-06-19/opensmtpd-development-bug-tracker-github/><h3 class="text-lg font-semibold mb-0.5">OpenSMTPD: development, bug tracker & GitHub</h3><div class="text-sm text-slate-500 dark:text-slate-400 line-clamp-2">It&rsquo;s been a while since my last post about OpenSMTPD.
I don&rsquo;t know what Eric and Charles have been up to, I was quite busy with my daytime job and couldn&rsquo;t really spend much time on the hobby ;-)
Anyways, one of the most requested feature of OpenSMTPD is to provide users with a mean to report bugs and let them contribute more easily. It&rsquo;s been requested two times this week, it&rsquo;s been requested countless times in the last few weeks and months, and as a matter of fact it&rsquo;s also been a nuisance for us as until now we&rsquo;ve kept track of bugs and feature requests in my mailbox.</div></a><a class="article block px-3 py-4 hover:bg-slate-200 dark:hover:bg-slate-700" href=/posts/2012-06-06/opensmtpd-rest-queue/><h3 class="text-lg font-semibold mb-0.5">OpenSMTPD REST queue</h3><div class="text-sm text-slate-500 dark:text-slate-400 line-clamp-2">This is the first post of a series to illustrate and describe a &ldquo;proof of concept&rdquo; code by Charles, Eric and I. I will describe the features as they are implemented.
Since mid-November 2011, OpenSMTPD offers support for an extensible queue API. The queue_backend API allows a developer to write a custom storage driver by implementing a small set of functions that take care of storing, updating and removing envelopes and messages.</div></a><a class="article block px-3 py-4 hover:bg-slate-200 dark:hover:bg-slate-700" href=/posts/2012-05-17/opensmtpd-src-address-maps-and-spamhaus/><h3 class="text-lg font-semibold mb-0.5">OpenSMTPD: src-address maps and spamhaus</h3><div class="text-sm text-slate-500 dark:text-slate-400 line-clamp-2">First of all, I&rsquo;d like to &ldquo;thank&rdquo; The Spamhaus project which forced me into hacking this feature in a hurry.
See, I rent a server at online.net which I use for OpenSMTPD live testing and to run some experimental code before it hits the OpenBSD tree.
Yesterday I received a mail from a user complaining that he couldn&rsquo;t send mail to a friend because we were listed on spamhaus. That was very strange because ALL users at poolp.</div></a><a class="article block px-3 py-4 hover:bg-slate-200 dark:hover:bg-slate-700" href=/posts/2012-05-14/opensmtpd-relay-maps-new-url-syntax/><h3 class="text-lg font-semibold mb-0.5">OpenSMTPD relay maps & new url syntax</h3><div class="text-sm text-slate-500 dark:text-slate-400 line-clamp-2">When we first started working on OpenSMTPD, we planned for future features but we did not necessarily start integrating them right away as the goal was to bootstrap the project first with basic features.
Amongst these features was the ability to use mappings for outgoing MX servers. Currently, OpenSMTPD knows two ways of going out:
Using the DNS system to find MX records: accept for [&mldr;] relay
Using the provided mail exchanger: accept for [&mldr;] relay via &ldquo;my-mx.</div></a><a class="article block px-3 py-4 hover:bg-slate-200 dark:hover:bg-slate-700" href=/posts/2012-05-13/opensmtpd-map_compare-and-k_netaddr/><h3 class="text-lg font-semibold mb-0.5">OpenSMTPD, map_compare() and K_NETADDR</h3><div class="text-sm text-slate-500 dark:text-slate-400 line-clamp-2">Ok, I already posted about the new SQLite map_backend earlier today but it turns out that I&rsquo;ve been very productive, and it was worth another post ;-)
So I decided to start improving our maps support and make them usable from places where they weren&rsquo;t.
primary domains
OpenSMTPD supports two kinds of domains: primary domains and virtual domains. The primary domains do not require providing a list of recipients as it will use system accounts; whereas virtual domains require a list of recipients and/or a fallback address to be provided within a map.</div></a><a class="article block px-3 py-4 hover:bg-slate-200 dark:hover:bg-slate-700" href=/posts/2012-05-12/opensmtpd-meets-sqlite/><h3 class="text-lg font-semibold mb-0.5">OpenSMTPD meets SQLite</h3><div class="text-sm text-slate-500 dark:text-slate-400 line-clamp-2">During the r2k12 hackathon in Paris, Marc Espie committed SQLite to OpenBSD&rsquo;s base system.
This has the side effect that OpenSMTPD can start using it and while we agreed that we did not want it as a strong dependency, the various backends API allow us to make it a soft dependency that can be removed without breaking the daemon if someone really does not want SQLite linked.
Today I decided to give it a try and implement a SQLite backend to the map API.</div></a><a class="article block px-3 py-4 hover:bg-slate-200 dark:hover:bg-slate-700" href=/posts/2012-05-09/some-opensmtpd-news/><h3 class="text-lg font-semibold mb-0.5">Some OpenSMTPD news</h3><div class="text-sm text-slate-500 dark:text-slate-400 line-clamp-2">It&rsquo;s been a whiiiiiiile since my last OpenSMTPD related post. Time to break the slacking, blog-wise.
Unlike what would appear from the outside, there&rsquo;s been a lot of activity, discussions and planning, I&rsquo;ll address some here and will discuss it further soon.
First of all, chl@ has committed to a private branch a major improvement to the filter API: async DNS lookups. Due to the design of OpenSMTPD, it is not acceptable for a filter to perform a blocking call as it will prevent it from processing other sessions.</div></a><a class="article block px-3 py-4 hover:bg-slate-200 dark:hover:bg-slate-700" href=/posts/2005-05-21/fatigue-et-envie-de-vacances.../><h3 class="text-lg font-semibold mb-0.5">fatigue et envie de vacances...</h3><div class="text-sm text-slate-500 dark:text-slate-400 line-clamp-2">Je sais pas pourquoi, mais je suis epuise alors que j&rsquo;ai dormi pres de 14h cette nuit.

</span></span></code></pre></div><p>However,
I realized that pretty much every single use of the package would require writing that <strong>very similar dispatcher function</strong> looping over the read channel,
and I also disliked the pattern of letting the user access the Golang channels directly as it made it easier to introduce mistakes in code for no benefit whatsoever.</p><p>I decided to rewrite the <code>ipcmsg.Channel()</code> function to return an opaque structure <strong>hiding the underlying channels</strong>,
and to provide a <code>channel.Dispatch()</code> function to start reading from the channel.
With this change,
the sample of code above now looks like:</p><div class=highlight><pre tabindex=0 style=color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#282a36;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4><code class=language-go data-lang=go><span style=display:flex><span><span style=color:#8be9fd;font-style:italic>func</span> <span style=color:#50fa7b>handlePING</span>(channel <span style=color:#ff79c6>*</span>ipcmsg.Channel, msg ipcmsg.IPCMessage) {

</span></span></span><span style=display:flex><span><span style=color:#6272a4></span>}
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>As you can see,
the message handling function receives an IPCMessage when one is available,
without having to loop on the read channel,
and the function setting up the channel can declare handlers for specific message types before calling the dispatcher.</p><p>In addition to this simplification,
I introduced a new mechanism:
<strong>synchronized messages</strong>.</p><p>In the <a href=https://man.openbsd.org/imsg_init.3 target=_blank rel=noopener>&lt;code>imsg(3)&lt;/code></a> API,
because it is written in C which doesn&rsquo;t provide coroutines,
messages are sent and <strong>code can&rsquo;t wait for an answer</strong> as it would <strong>block the entire process</strong> meanwhile.
To avoid this,
code to emit a message and code to handle answers are <strong>decoupled</strong>:
a function sends and stops caring about the message&mldr; until another function gets an answer and resumes what the first intended to do if it could have waited for an answer.
Splitting code like this is always doable,
but it can be <strong>more or less tricky with some patterns</strong> where you&rsquo;d benefit from having a very sequential read.</p><p>Because I can use Goroutines here and have them interrupt their execution in place without blocking the entire process,
I introduced two additional calls:</p><div class=highlight><pre tabindex=0 style=color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#282a36;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4><code class=language-golang data-lang=golang><span style=display:flex><span><span style=color:#6272a4>// channel.Query() blocks the goroutine and resumes execution
</span></span></span><span style=display:flex><span><span style=color:#6272a4>// only when the other end has used channel.Reply()
</span></span></span><span style=display:flex><span><span style=color:#6272a4>//

</span></span><span style=display:flex><span><span style=color:#ff79c6>if</span> msgtype <span style=color:#ff79c6>!=</span> IPCMSG_PONG {
</span></span><span style=display:flex><span>    <span style=color:#8be9fd;font-style:italic>panic</span>(<span style=color:#f1fa8c>&#34;THE WORLD IS COMING TO AN END.&#34;</span>)
</span></span><span style=display:flex><span>}
</span></span><span style=display:flex><span>fmt.<span style=color:#50fa7b>Println</span>(<span style=color:#f1fa8c>&#34;got appropriate response to my query&#34;</span>)
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>This pattern is not necessarily better than the split pattern,
they both have their use-cases which is why <code>go-ipcmsg</code> provides both,
but in some situations it <strong>really makes code much less complex than interrupting execution to resume in another function</strong>.</p><p>The code is already available <a href=https://github.com/poolpOrg/go-ipcmsg target=_blank rel=noopener>in a Github repository</a>,
and it works enough that I use it in various proof of concepts I write,
but it still isn&rsquo;t ready to use in production and was only tested by me.</p><p>Feel free to test and report issues ;-)</p><h1 id=go-privsep>Go-privsep</h1><p><a href=/posts/2021-04-30/april-2021-opensmtpd-plakar-ipcmsg-privsep-and-a-small-hypnosis-talk/#go-privsep>In April</a>,
I also wrote about <a href=https://github.com/poolpOrg/go-privsep target=_blank rel=noopener>&lt;code>go-privsep&lt;/code></a>,
a package to ease the writing of OpenBSD-style daemons in Golang.</p><p>The idea behind it is that most OpenBSD-style daemons use the same multi-process design,
yet every project has to have <strong>a different setup logic</strong> because they differ in the number of processes,
which processes communicate with each other,
and which messages they sent one to another.</p><p>I disliked having to bootstrap a new daemon but at least <strong>I could copy</strong> chunks from a previous one and adapt,
but this doesn&rsquo;t work with Golang as I have not found any OpenBSD-like daemon to copy from.
So I thought maybe I should solve the main issue which is making the part that annoys me&mldr; less annoying,
this way I don&rsquo;t have to bother much setting up a new daemon architecture and I don&rsquo;t have to copy code from another daemon either.</p><p>The result is a package that allows to <strong>declare how the daemon is supposed to look like</strong> when it enters its event loop,
and the package takes care of creating the processes,
the communication channels between them,
dropping privileges and chrooting where appropriate,
before having each process enter its own entry point.</p><p>In the following example,
I have <strong>created a daemon with a design similar to OpenSMTPD</strong>&mldr;
except that all entry points are idle because it&rsquo;s not a real daemon 😁</p><div class=highlight><pre tabindex=0 style=color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#282a36;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4><code class=language-go data-lang=go><span style=display:flex><span><span style=color:#8be9fd;font-style:italic>func</span> <span style=color:#50fa7b>main</span>() {

all daemons share a <code>parse.y</code> file containing their specific (yet very similar) grammar built on top of the same lexer.

I just couldn&rsquo;t.</p><p>I have started working on <code>go-parsey</code>,
a small package that allows declaring a configuration grammar that more resembles what I like.

<strong>don&rsquo;t hold your breath</strong>,
this isn&rsquo;t a serious project and I&rsquo;ll work on it on and off throughout 2022.</p><h1 id=plakar>Plakar</h1><p>I did a TON of work on <code>plakar</code> with <strong>over 150 public commits</strong> and some more in a private branch.</p><p>The following subsections will describe the most interesting changes,
<strong>in no particular order</strong>,
though many more are interesting for the project but not so much for an article.</p><h2 id=tried-failed-to-fix-fuse-support-build-on-openbsd>Tried (failed) to fix <code>fuse</code> support build on OpenBSD&mldr;</h2><p>But it turns out that after fixing my code,
then fixing the code in the dependency,
I hit a problem in Golang&rsquo;s runtime as the mount system call is not implemented for OpenBSD yet.
I have a diff but I haven&rsquo;t been able to test it yet as I don&rsquo;t feel like breaking my runtime right now.</p><p>The rabbit hole was deep and I fell in it.</p><h2 id=rewrote-the-network-code>Rewrote the network code</h2><p>I did a lot of work in both client and server code to clean them from the disgusting proof of concept to something decent,
and allowing more parallelism of operations.
I still have work to do in that area but the foundations are clean now.</p><p>The network code now uses <code>gob</code> to produce <strong>a binary protocol</strong> that I don&rsquo;t have to parse myself thanks to <code>gob</code> encoders/decoders working directly on a connection handler,
what a pleasure to not have to do that myself.</p><p>The server can now handle concurrent requests from the same client:
for example it is capable to process multiple requests at once contrarily to before,
speeding up considerably transfers.</p><p>The client also benefited from concurrency improvements.</p><h2 id=reworked-the-storage-interface>Reworked the storage interface</h2><p>I reworked the storage interface to ease the writing of custom storage backends,
it is now relatively easy to write a backend and plug it in plakar without having to make changes outside of the implementation.</p><p>This sounds like nothing but interface implementation in Golang was puzzling me and I&rsquo;m happy I worked it out.</p><h2 id=added-support-for-an-sqlite-storage-backend>Added support for an SQLite storage backend</h2><p>With the storage layer reworked,
I implemented an SQLite storage allowing <code>plakar</code> to use an SQLite database instead of the filesystem:</p><div class=highlight><pre tabindex=0 style=color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#282a36;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4><code class=language-shell data-lang=shell><span style=display:flex><span>$ plakar on sqlite:///tmp/plakar.db create -no-encryption

</span></span><span style=display:flex><span>$
</span></span></code></pre></div><p><strike>This has advantages and disadvantages.</strike></p><p>SQLite backend is <strong>MUCH faster</strong> than using the filesystem on a <code>plakar push</code> / <code>plakar pull</code>,
mainly because <strong>operations are reduced to reads & writes</strong> in SQLite when the FS has to <strong>open / close</strong> files too for each chunk and object accesses.
The <strong>commit of a snapshot in SQLite is very efficient and fast</strong>,
whereas on the FS it can take a long while due to <strong>a lot of hard links tricks</strong>.
<strike>But&mldr; on the other end,
I trust my filesystem more than SQLite and I don&rsquo;t have to worry about <strong>multiple concurrent writers</strong> there.</strike></p><blockquote><p>Edit:
After thinking more about it, my irrational fear of storing backups in a single structured binary file doesn&rsquo;t hold:
I already do it with tarballs.</p><p>I also had a concern with concurrent writes because, many years ago, a writer would lock the entire database.
This would for instance prevent plakar from pushing a small snapshot while a very big one was holding a transaction for an extended period of time.
But I was stuck in the past, as SQLite introduced a WAL &mldr; 11 years ago.</p><p>Thanks to Glandos @ Github for questionning my SQLite fear which had me revisit the concurrent writers concern and realize it no longer held ground,
this will be very useful as even the SQLite code I wrote still assumed this old behaviour:</p><p>For example, the local cache opens the database in read-only and keeps track of all writes it wants to do,
then when a snapshot is committed, it reopens the database in write mode to flush changes and reduce the time it had to retain the database open.
This whole contorted way of working is no longer relevant and code can be simplified a lot.</p></blockquote><p>What&rsquo;s interesting is that SQLite support uses a generic SQL database connector,
so I will be able to implement support for any SQL database by rewriting some queries&mldr;
and obviously I have in mind databases that allow replication.</p><h2 id=optimized-local-cache-logic-and-replaced-with-an-sqlite-implementation>Optimized local cache logic and replaced with an SQLite implementation</h2><p>The local cache implementation was suboptimal,
only useful to test the logic but not really to improve performances,
partly because it&rsquo;s way of working was <strong>stepping in the way of the push algorithm</strong>&mldr;
so I reworked it to improve the situation.</p><p>While at it,
<strong>I switched from the previous FS-based local cache to an SQLite local cache</strong>,
mainly to avoid the cost of multiple system calls whenever checking if something was in cache.</p><h2 id=implemented-a-small-plakar-shell>Implemented a small plakar shell</h2><p>Nothing too fancy,
I just needed to be able to run multiple commands on the same plakar session,
the shell just accepts commands and applies them to the same opened plakar.</p><div class=highlight><pre tabindex=0 style=color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#282a36;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4><code class=language-shell data-lang=shell><span style=display:flex><span>$ plakar on sqlite:///tmp/plakar.db shell

</span></span></code></pre></div><p>That doesn&rsquo;t look too useful but that&rsquo;s because in my articles I mainly provide examples on an <code>-no-encryption</code> plakar,
so you don&rsquo;t see me prompted for a passphrase every command I type.
When you have to type multiple commands,
using the <code>plakar shell</code> will only prompt at opening saving sanity.</p><h2 id=implemented-a-filesystem-view>Implemented a filesystem view</h2><p>The snapshot indexes consisted mainly of maps mapping checksums to pathnames or pathnames to file informations, etc&mldr;</p><p>This was efficient for <strong>direct access to a resource by its name</strong>,
like searching what&rsquo;s the file informations for <code>/etc/passwd</code>,
but not so much for operations involving <strong>partial pathnames</strong>,
such as finding what files are in a directory.
Unfortunately such operations are numerous as <code>plakar</code> supports a <code>ls</code> command to browse the snapshot,
but also <code>cat</code>-ing, <code>pull</code>-ing or even creating tarballs from subdirectories within a snapshot.</p><p>To work around,
I had implemented helpers that would do things like comparing full pathnames and determining if a path was within another,
but this was confusing and inefficient as it required looking at the entire set of entries in the snapshot,
and playing games with string prefixes.</p><p>I <strong>implemented a filesystem within the index in the form a tree of file informations</strong>,
as well as a set of functions to lookup pathnames in that tree.
This has considerably simplified a lot of code and allows to lookup resources in the index similarly to how I would on the real filesystem.</p><p>I kept the maps as indexes for direct lookups so that whenever searching for a precise resource,
there is no need to go through the filesystem and traverse nodes,
but so that whenever searching for a set of resources or trying to discover what&rsquo;s in a directory hierarchy,
the tree can be used instead.</p><h2 id=implement-cpu-throttling>Implement CPU throttling</h2><p>Until now,
<code>plakar</code> would <strong>use all of the available resources</strong> to perform operations as fast as possible.</p><center><img src=cpu-nothrottling.jpeg height=300px></center><p>While I think the default should be to <strong>run as close as possible to max limit</strong> and let the machine throttle,
it&rsquo;s also not a good idea to not leave at least one core for the OS to work correctly.</p><p>I implemented CPU throttling so that <code>plakar</code> can be told to limit itself to a certain number of cores with the <code>-cpu</code> option,
and I set the default to be between <code>1</code> and <code>cpus-1</code> cpus, whichever is the most.
On a 1 core VPS,
it will consume up to a full CPU,
while on my 8 core laptop it will consume 7 by default.</p><p>The effect of passing a <code>-cpu</code> option are quite visible as you can see with this <code>plakar -cpu 4 push ...</code></p><center><img src=cpu-throttling.jpeg height=300px></center><h2 id=simplify-and-optimize-plakar-push>Simplify and optimize <code>plakar push</code></h2><p>I reworked the <code>push</code> logic to simplify and optimize the strategy,
leading to <strong>less store calls</strong> and much improved performances with much more readable code.</p><p>With the help of discord user Spire,
improvements were made leading to performances boosts due to <strong>code patterns that caused too many allocations</strong>.</p><p>There are still improvements to make but things are looking bright 😃</p><h2 id=parallelized-plakar-keep-plakar-rm-plakar-ls>Parallelized <code>plakar keep</code>, <code>plakar rm</code>, <code>plakar ls</code></h2><p>Both <code>plakar keep</code> and <code>plakar rm</code> worked by <strong>removing snapshots sequentially</strong> from the store,
I updated them so that they could run the <strong>removals in concurrency</strong>,
allowing for faster execution.</p><p>The <code>plakar ls</code> case was similar in that to display the snapshots listing,
it had to fetch the snapshot indexes,
and it did that sequentially.
When multiple big snapshot indexes were in the store,
this could lead to a delay before the listing was displayed as <strong>each snapshot index would be fetched and deserialized sequentially</strong>,
not exploiting the availability of multiple cores.
I converted <code>plakar ls</code> to use concurrency for the fetch and deserialize,
synchronizing the routines before the sorting and display.</p><h2 id=fixed-ui>Fixed UI</h2><p>The UI was badly broken due to the many changes I made in the API,
so I spent a while fixing it and <strong>taking advantage of the new snapshot filesystem view</strong> to provide directory browsing:</p><center><img src=cover.png></center><p>I also improved slightly the view for individual resources,
added the ability to <strong>download file</strong>s or <strong>tarballs</strong>.</p><h2 id=implemented-plakar-clone>Implemented <code>plakar clone</code></h2><p>I wrote a <code>plakar clone</code> command to fully replicate a repository:</p><div class=highlight><pre tabindex=0 style=color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#282a36;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4><code class=language-shell data-lang=shell><span style=display:flex><span>$ plakar on sqlite:///tmp/plakar.db clone /tmp/cloned

</span></span></code></pre></div><p>This allows creating an <strong>exact replica of an existing plakar repository</strong>,
regardless of where it&rsquo;s located (filesystem, network or database) into a local directory,
and respecting the internal structure of the original repository:
it is not just a dumb file copy but really the <strong>cloning of the internal state</strong>,
<strong>preserving reference counts and such</strong>.</p><p>The fact that it can only clone to a local directory is a temporary technical limitation that <strong>will be lifted in the future</strong> as my ultimate goal is to be able to:</p><div class=highlight><pre tabindex=0 style=color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#282a36;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4><code class=language-shell data-lang=shell><span style=display:flex><span>$ plakar on plakar://192.168.1.2 clone plakar://192.168.1.1

</span></span></code></pre></div><p>&mldr; and have a plakar be reconstructed from a remote machine to another remote machine.</p><p>The idea is that you can clone an off-site plakar on a regular basis and know that if something happened to the main one,
you&rsquo;d still have a version of it that has a <strong>coherent internal state</strong>.
When the local filesystem technical limitation is lifted,
I&rsquo;ll working on a <strong>synchronization mechanism</strong> so that two remote plakar may exchange chunks, objects and snapshots in an efficient way,
without having to clone the entire repository.</p><h2 id=implemented-plakar-check-and-fast-checking>Implemented <code>plakar check</code> and fast checking</h2><p>The <code>plakar check &lt;snapshot></code> command already existed to <strong>check the integrity of a snapshot</strong> by requesting the store to return each of its chunks and objects,
allowing <code>plakar</code> to both validate that it could perform a full restore if needed and that checksums matched.</p><p>After a discussion on Discord,
I implemented <strong>fast checking</strong> which is a relaxed check requesting only that the store acknowledges existence of chunks and objects.
This allows speeding up <strong>considerably</strong> the snapshot checks when you trust the store to respond honestly on the availability of resources.</p><p>I finally implemented <code>plakar check</code> (no snapshot parameter) to perform a <strong>full plakar repository coherency check</strong>,
validating that the store doesn&rsquo;t contain orphan chunks and objects,
but also that they have a reference count matching the number of snapshots relying on them,
and that no snapshot lacks a reference to a resource that&rsquo;s still in the store&mldr; only because it is held by another snapshot.</p><p>As long as a resource is available in the store,
even if the snapshot lost its reference somehow,
plakar will manage to restore the resource:
this is nice because you don&rsquo;t want to fail recovering something for which you do have the data,
but you also don&rsquo;t want that to hide the fact that there was a corruption in the store somehow.</p><p>In theory,
<strong>unless you poke in the store and remove resources yourself</strong>,
these checks are never meant to fail but I&rsquo;ll sleep better knowing that I can have daily snapshots fast checks,
weekly snapshot checks and monthly repository checks&mldr;
and that if something goes wrong,
I can pull a backup and investigate what went wrong.</p><p>A nice improvement would be to provide the ability to repair some corruptions when doable,
but since this is not supposed to happen in the first place,
it&rsquo;s not very high in my list 😁</p><h1 id=assorted-other-work>Assorted other work</h1><p>After a month of learning,
I can now play <strong>Ode to Joy</strong>, <strong>Autumn Leaves</strong>, and <strong>And I love her</strong> on the piano, that required some assorted work.</p><hr><p>Comments: <a href=https://github.com/poolpOrg/poolp.org/discussions/140 target=_blank rel=noopener>https://github.com/poolpOrg/poolp.org/discussions/140</a></p><script src=https://giscus.app/client.js data-repo=poolpOrg/poolp.org data-repo-id="MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMjYxODk2MjA=" data-category=Articles data-category-id=DIC_kwDOB4WANM4B-Zf1 data-mapping=og:title data-strict=0 data-reactions-enabled=1 data-emit-metadata=1 data-input-position=top data-theme=light data-lang=en data-loading=lazy crossorigin=anonymous async></script></article></div></div><script type=text/javascript src=/main.js defer></script></body></html>
