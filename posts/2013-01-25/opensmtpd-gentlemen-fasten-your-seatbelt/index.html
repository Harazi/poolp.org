This will be a long-standing task, but we have already improved memory usage considerably under high-load, we&rsquo;re pretty happy with the result.</p><p>All of the following has been committed, we published snapshots and we sync-ed the OpenBSD tree with our own repository so that OpenBSD-current now has all of the features, improvements and bug fixes we came up with in the last few weeks (or months for some stuff we didn&rsquo;t backport).</p><p>Anyway, here goes a summary and I&rsquo;m off to bed as I&rsquo;m sick as shit.</p><p>fix a descriptor leak</p><p>We were told of a crash which appeared to be coming from a descriptor leak. On Linux, lsof would display that message files were removed while the transfer process still had a descriptor opened. We tracked the issue and spotted that it would happen because of a missing condition in the transfer process where the message file would not be closed if recipients were rejected and the session was reused to send another message. Two liner fix.</p><p>SSL code cleanup</p><p>An OpenBSD user reported a problem with ldapd&rsquo;s ssl.c where the prime used for DH parameters was 512 bits which is short enough by today&rsquo;s standards to be rejected by OpenLDAP&rsquo;s client. OpenSMTPD&rsquo;s ssl.c has been changed a long time ago to bump this prime to a 1024 bits prime, but ldapd&rsquo;s ssl.c was actually a copy of OpenSMTPD&rsquo;s ssl.c from two years ago.</p><p>The desynchronization of ssl.c accross OpenBSD daemons has annoyed me for a long time but it occured to me that maintaining this gap would be causing further divergences in the future as reyk@ moves OpenIKED and relayd forward. After a quick chat with him I started creating a daemon-agnostic version of ssl.c.</p><p>There is still work to do in that area, but OpenSMTPD now comes with a ssl_privsep.c that is equivalent to that of relayd; a ssl.c file that no longer knows of any smtpd specific structures and which can be shared with other daemons; a ssl_smtpd.c that contains the smtpd-specific bits.</p><p>Note that ssl.c doesn&rsquo;t contain new code, this was only a rework of the interfaces to allow it to be shareable with different daemons.</p><p>Runtime tracing and profiling</p><p>I have added a feature that I&rsquo;ve been wanting for a long time: activating traces at runtime without a daemon restart.</p><p>Say a user suddenly observes that connections to a remote host fails, he can now simply type: smtpctl trace transfer</p><p>To obtain a real-time view of the sessions as they take place with remote hosts.</p><p>There are many trace subsystems, for incoming connections, outgoing connections, msg exchanges accross processes, etc, etc, &mldr; read the man page ;-)</p><p>While at it, if you need to verify bottlenecks OpenSMTPD also supports real-time profiling of imsg and queue using: smtpctl profile imsg and smtpctl profile queue</p><p>Both tracing and profiling can be turned on and off at runtime.</p><p>Improve memory use</p><p>Eric cleaned up some code to avoid passing envelopes when we could pass evpid instead. This prevents OpenSMTPD from accumulating data in the inter-process buffers (an evpid is 64bits, an envelope structure is several kbytes).</p><p>For the places where the envelope really needs to be passed, he suggested that we send a compressed version. I proposed that we use the ASCII envelope conversion as we know it works given that it&rsquo;s already used for disk-based envelopes. The ascii envelopes allow compressing the envelope quite a lot as instead of passing a large datastructure with partially used large fields, we pass the ascii representation that can be as small as a hundred bytes.</p><p>We should now be able to cope better in very heavily loaded situations ;-)</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=https%3a%2f%2fpoolp.org%2fposts%2f2013-01-25%2fopensmtpd-gentlemen-fasten-your-seatbelt%2f&text=OpenSMTPD%3a%20gentlemen%2c%20fasten%20your%20seatbelt&via=poolpOrg" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=https%3a%2f%2fpoolp.org%2fposts%2f2013-01-25%2fopensmtpd-gentlemen-fasten-your-seatbelt%2f" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=https%3a%2f%2fpoolp.org%2fposts%2f2013-01-25%2fopensmtpd-gentlemen-fasten-your-seatbelt%2f&title=OpenSMTPD%3a%20gentlemen%2c%20fasten%20your%20seatbelt" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=https%3a%2f%2fpoolp.org%2fposts%2f2013-01-25%2fopensmtpd-gentlemen-fasten-your-seatbelt%2f&title=OpenSMTPD%3a%20gentlemen%2c%20fasten%20your%20seatbelt" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=https%3a%2f%2fpoolp.org%2fposts%2f2013-01-25%2fopensmtpd-gentlemen-fasten-your-seatbelt%2f&title=OpenSMTPD%3a%20gentlemen%2c%20fasten%20your%20seatbelt" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=https%3a%2f%2fpoolp.org%2fposts%2f2013-01-25%2fopensmtpd-gentlemen-fasten-your-seatbelt%2f&description=OpenSMTPD%3a%20gentlemen%2c%20fasten%20your%20seatbelt" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=https://poolp.org/posts/2013-01-18/opensmtpd-stress-and-features/ data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="OpenSMTPD: stress and features">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=https://poolp.org/posts/2013-02-02/opensmtpd-minor-fixes-preparing-release/ data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="OpenSMTPD: minor fixes + preparing release">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer style=text-align:justify><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><h2>Like my work and want to help me ?</h2><br><ul><li>Consider <b>tipping me</b> on <b><a target=_blank href=https://paypal.me/poolpOrg>PayPal</a></b>,
