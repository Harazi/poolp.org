</code></pre><h2 id=whats-spf-in-a-few-words>What&rsquo;s SPF in a few words</h2><p>SPF is the Sender Policy Framework, a standard to verify the domain name of an e-mail sender.</p><p>Long story short, the SMTP protocol does not come with a way to authenticate a domain and,
during an SMTP session,
nothing really prevents a sender from pretending to come from any domain:</p><pre><code>$ nc localhost 25 
220 poolp.org ESMTP OpenSMTPD
HELO pussycat
250 poolp.org Hello pussycat [127.0.0.1], pleased to meet you
MAIL FROM:&lt;gilles@systemd.lol&gt;
250 2.0.0: Ok
^C
$ 
</code></pre><p>Note that this is a feature of the SMTP protocol, not a bug.</p><p>It turns out that the internet is a hostile place and people started abusing this so&mldr;
the solution,
as usual when it comes to SMTP,
was to shove data inside DNS records \o/</p><p>SPF allows the owner of a DNS zone to declare which machines are allowed to send mail on behalf of the domain in a TXT record.
With this feature,
whenever a spammer attempts to send mail on behalf of @google.com,
the receiving MX can simply check that the client is allowed to send mail by the google.com zone.</p><p>This seems lovely,
however it&rsquo;s not a spam killer because it actually requires senders to create the record,
destination nodes to actually check the TXT record and match the client address against it,
and it doesn&rsquo;t prevent spammers from adding SPF records to their own domains.</p><p>What it does,
when everything is setup correctly on both ends,
is protect the destination node from spammers trying to impersonnate a sender domain&mldr;
as long as the spammer doesn&rsquo;t control a machine declared in the TXT record [ it&rsquo;s easy to whitelist a /16 ;) ].</p><h2 id=greylisting>Greylisting</h2><p>A technique that&rsquo;s been used widely to reduce spam is to rely on greylisting.</p><p>Basically,
when a MX you don&rsquo;t know connects to your node,
it gets bounced with a temporary failure requesting a retry.
All SMTP server know how to handle these retries,
however in a spamming economy based on sending volumes of messages it&rsquo;s often not worth it to retry on temporary failures.</p><p>Spammers will come from many source addresses,
keep being seen as new MX,
keep being bounced,
life is good.</p><p>Why am I talking about greylisting you ask ?</p><h2 id=when-big-mailers-made-it-easier-for-spammers-to-annoy-us>When BIG MAILERS made it easier for spammers to annoy us</h2><p>It&rsquo;s impolite to point fingers so I won&rsquo;t name them explicitely,
you know who they are.</p><p>Greylisting works lovely to waste spammers' time&mldr;
as long as you can assume legitimate hosts come from the same IP addresses.</p><p>At some point,
BIG MAILERS decided that:
nope, we&rsquo;ll send from this host,
then we&rsquo;ll retry from this one,
then another one,
and then since we have hundreds of IP addresses available,
well just fuck you, we&rsquo;ll make sure we never hit you twice with the same.</p><p>I don&rsquo;t know if these were the exact words,
but it essentially leads to that &ldquo;fuck you&rdquo; result so&mldr;</p><p>Since BIG MAILERS could not send from a small set of addresses and reuse the same ones upon retries,
they started advertising their MX in SPF records.
And by that I mean,
they started whitelisting full ranges in records requiring recursive and cross-domains lookups because WHY NOT ?</p><p>This way, greylisting became essentially unusable to many who turned it off because they can&rsquo;t easily whitelist BIG MAILERS.</p><h2 id=this-is-how-we-get-to-spfwalk>This is how we get to <code>spfwalk</code></h2><p>We don&rsquo;t want to NOT have greylisting,
so we want a tool to actually harvest records enabled in BIG MAILERS' SPF record.</p><p>deraadt@ ran into an issue with one of his MX which had BIG MAILERS unable to pass greylisting.
He asked me if I could write a utility to fetch SPF records and insert them into a PF table to whitelist MX for particular domains.</p><p>Coincidentally,
Aaron Poffenberger announced the next day that he had been working on a tool called <code>spf_fetch</code> <a href=https://github.com/akpoff/spf_fetch>https://github.com/akpoff/spf_fetch</a> to do just that. The idea was nice however it couldn&rsquo;t be committed to OpenBSD as is because it is written as a set of shell scripts and we wanted a piece of code that could be <code>pledge()</code>-ed.</p><p>I contacted Aaron and told him I was going to be working on a C version based on the asr asynchronous resolver,
and told him I would appreciate if he contributed since he had already started a similar project.
A few weeks later,
we had a work in progress <code>spfwalk</code> utility commited to my repository <a href=https://github.com/poolpOrg/spfwalk>https://github.com/poolpOrg/spfwalk</a>.</p><h2 id=smtpctl-spf-walk>smtpctl spf walk</h2><p>Instead of having a new utility committed to base,
we decided to make it a subcommand of the <code>smtpctl</code> utility.</p><p>The main idea is that <code>smtpctl spf walk</code> will read a list of domains from stdin and output a list of IP addresses and ranges to stdout,
allowing it to be used in scripts,
to generate file lists,
or to be piped directly into <code>pfctl</code> to feed a table.</p><p>This is still a work in progress,
but it allows you to <code>cat /etc/mail/BIGMAILERS.txt | smtpctl spf walk | pfctl -t spf-white -T add -f -</code>,
which is quite an improvement over having nothing to do it to start with :-)</p><h2 id=final-words>Final words</h2><p>sunil@ merged my utility to <code>smtpctl</code>,
I made sure it ran unprivileged,
so now we have an spf fetching utility that runs unprivileged and <code>pledge()</code>-ed in the base system.</p><p>This was committed a few days ago to OpenBSD -current,
it requires testing because I&rsquo;m pretty sure it has bugs still.</p><hr><p>Want to comment ? <a href=https://github.com/poolpOrg/poolpOrg.github.io/issues/>Open an issue on Github</a></p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=https%3a%2f%2fpoolp.org%2fposts%2f2018-01-08%2fspfwalk%2f&text=spfwalk&via=poolpOrg" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=https%3a%2f%2fpoolp.org%2fposts%2f2018-01-08%2fspfwalk%2f" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=https%3a%2f%2fpoolp.org%2fposts%2f2018-01-08%2fspfwalk%2f&title=spfwalk" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=https%3a%2f%2fpoolp.org%2fposts%2f2018-01-08%2fspfwalk%2f&title=spfwalk" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=https%3a%2f%2fpoolp.org%2fposts%2f2018-01-08%2fspfwalk%2f&title=spfwalk" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=https%3a%2f%2fpoolp.org%2fposts%2f2018-01-08%2fspfwalk%2f&description=spfwalk" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=https://poolp.org/posts/2018-01-08/news-from-the-front/ data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="News from the front !">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=https://poolp.org/posts/2018-01-29/install-openbsd-on-dedibox-with-full-disk-encryption/ data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Install OpenBSD on dedibox with full-disk encryption">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer style=text-align:justify><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><h2>Like my work and want to help me ?</h2><br><ul><li>Consider <b>tipping me</b> on <b><a target=_blank href=https://paypal.me/poolpOrg>PayPal</a></b>,
