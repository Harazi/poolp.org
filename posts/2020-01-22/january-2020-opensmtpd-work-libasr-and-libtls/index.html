As we get closer and closer to the next major release,
my work on new features will slow down to focus more on getting the release in shape.</p><p>I spent this month working on plumbing and stuff that&rsquo;s not necessarily very visible to users,
as well as multiple features that will <strong>NOT</strong> be part of the next release but will be committed shortly after release is tagged.</p><p>This month I focused on simplifying OpenSMTPD portable packaging by removing the need for <code>libasr</code> dependency.
I also worked on making <code>libtls</code>-enabled OpenSMTPD possible for portable,
a long awaited change that was not trivial and that will be skipped for the next release as it is very invasive.</p><h2 id=libasr-brought-back-to-compat-layer>libasr brought back to compat layer</h2><p>For various purposes,
OpenSMTPD relies <strong>a lot</strong> on DNS lookups and requires them to be <strong>non-blocking</strong>.</p><p>In May 2009,
because we didn&rsquo;t want threading in the daemon,
a former developer implemented this using a <code>fork()</code>-based approach.
In November 2010,
I replaced the <code>fork()</code>-based non-blocking resolver with <code>asr</code>,
a then experimental asynchronous resolver written by <code>eric@</code>,
which uses an asynchronous-friendly interface that can be used with a multiplexer.
In other words,
<code>asr</code> allows DNS lookups to happen in parallel without multi-processing or multi-threading,
and results to be notified through <code>select()</code>, <code>poll()</code> or similar interfaces (<code>libevent</code> in the case of OpenSMTPD).</p><p>As <code>asr</code> is not a standard interface,
OpenSMTPD initially shipped it with its compat layer so it could be built on other BSD & Linux.
Back then,
the release process didn&rsquo;t include major / minor / portable-only releases,
and <code>asr</code> was still a moving target with bugs being spotted every few weeks.
This led to a very annoying situation as bugs in <code>asr</code> required a new OpenSMTPD release,
sometimes a few days apart.</p><p>We decided to split <code>asr</code> from OpenSMTPD and have it as a standalone library,
with its own releases.
This was a bit inconvenient because it meant package maintainers had to to maintain two packages,
one for OpenSMTPD and one for <code>asr</code>,
but it allowed us to decorellate both releases which was very helpful at that point.</p><p>Years passed,
OpenSMTPD improved its release management and <code>asr</code> stabilized so much that four years passed without a need for release,
but this split was not reconsidered&mldr;
until recently.</p><p>In 2019,
after filters were released,
I started working heavily on improving our portable layer which <a href=https://poolp.org/posts/2019-11-17/november-2019-report-opensmtpd-6.6.1p1-filter-greylist-and-tons-of-portable-cleanup/>suffered multiple shortcomings</a>.
While discussing with <em>eric@</em>,
we came up with the conclusion that <code>asr</code> should now be brought back to OpenSMTPD compat layer:
unlike years ago,
rolling a portable-specific release to fix a bug in the compat layer is something we do,
and it is now inconvenient for us to have the two split apart.</p><p>The compat layers had diverged a bit so I did the work to bring back <code>asr</code> to OpenSMTPD,
conditionally compiling it if not available on the system.
Starting with the next major version,
6.7.0 due sometime in April/May,
the portable release of OpenSMTPD will no longer require a <code>libasr</code> dependency and <code>--with-libasr</code> configure flag.
It will autodetect if it is available on the system and conditionally build the compat layer one if it isn&rsquo;t.</p><h2 id=libtls--for-systems-without-libressl>libtls &mldr; for systems without LibreSSL</h2><p>To quote the LibreSSL home page:</p><blockquote><p>LibreSSL is a version of the TLS/crypto stack forked from OpenSSL in 2014, with goals of modernizing the codebase, improving security, and applying best practice development processes.</p></blockquote><p>Among the improvements that LibreSSL brought was a new <code>libtls</code> library,
described as follow:</p><blockquote><p><code>libtls</code>: a new TLS library, designed to make it easier to write foolproof applications.</p></blockquote><center><img src=/images/2020-01-22-libtls.jpg></center><p>Indeed,
as someone who started using OpenSSL and <code>libssl</code> as a student during the 2000&rsquo;s,
I can attest that using the library is overly complex and writing foolproof applications is a challenge.
I won&rsquo;t expand more because this post is not about OpenSSL bashing.
Lets just say that <strong>it&rsquo;s easy to write code that works</strong> using <code>libssl</code>,
but <strong>it&rsquo;s very hard to know if that code is correct or overlooking an option or a flag somewhere</strong>.
Part of this is because crypto is not easy and you must know what you&rsquo;re doing,
but a bigger part of this is because the API doesn&rsquo;t make it any easier:
its attempt at being extremely flexible and allowing a developer to do pretty much anything provides multiple ways for a developer to fail and shoot their own feet.</p><p>The <code>libtls</code> interface is <strong>a wrapper</strong> around <code>libssl</code> which exposes a much simpler interface.
It provides sane defaults,
so that missing something somewhere doesn&rsquo;t result in a less secure setup,
but it also provides <em>less</em> possibilities of tweaking everything which is often better for <em>most</em> people.
This results in TLS code that&rsquo;s considerably smaller,
easier to understand and less error-prone.</p><p>I have had in my plans to convert OpenSMTPD to <code>libtls</code> since it was first released,
but couldn&rsquo;t switch to that interface because it <strong>requires LibreSSL</strong> and many systems still do not provide a package for it:
a switch to <code>libtls</code> would essentially kill OpenSMTPD portable.
Another option could be to build a standalone <code>libtls</code> that carries LibreSSL&rsquo;s <code>libssl</code>,
<a href=https://github.com/reyk/libressl-deb>which is just what <em>reyk@</em> did</a>.
His approach is a very good trade-off and I hope it catches with his standalone <code>libtls</code> becoming widespread.</p><p>In the meantime,
OpenSMTPD cannot use <code>libtls</code> interface without breaking on systems that didn&rsquo;t package his work and&mldr;
experience shows it might take time.
A time during which we&rsquo;re still forced to use <code>libssl</code> interface,
writing complex code that no one is confident reviewing.
This is highly annoying because multiple features were put on hold until the <code>libtls</code> switch,
some have been deferred for so long that its a bit difficult to defer them some more.
At some point we need to either implement them using the <code>libssl</code> interface,
which will take time and efforts for code that we don&rsquo;t intend to keep,
or find a way to <strong>use the <code>libtls</code> interface with OpenSSL</strong>&rsquo;s <code>libssl</code> as a &ldquo;degraded&rdquo; mode.</p><p>Since <code>libtls</code> is <strong>a wrapper</strong> around <code>libssl</code>,
you&rsquo;d figure that this shouldn&rsquo;t be too hard BUT LibreSSL and OpenSSL diverged on a few things,
the <code>libssl</code> interface now has a few differences in terms of structures,
functions available and options to these functions.
You can&rsquo;t just grab <code>libtls</code> and build it with OpenSSL,
it won&rsquo;t for a variety of reasons.</p><p>I didn&rsquo;t want to spend time working on an OpenSSL version of a standalone <code>libtls</code>:
I believe there are good reasons why LibreSSL was forked and I&rsquo;d rather see more people use LibreSSL than endorsing OpenSSL myself.
So&mldr; I found a middle-ground which seemed the most pramatic to me.</p><p>I have brought <code>libtls</code> from latest LibreSSL into the <strong>compat layer</strong> of OpenSMTPD,
then did the <strong><em>strict minimum</em></strong> to allow it to build and link with OpenSSL <strong>to cover OpenSMTPD&rsquo;s needs and nothing more</strong>.
This allowed me to convert OpenSMTPD to the <code>libtls</code> interface simplifying <em>an awesome lot</em> of code,
while being able to build on any system wether it ships LibreSSL or not.</p><p>So how does this differ from a standalone <code>libtls</code> ?</p><p>OpenSMTPD&rsquo;s configure will detect if LibreSSL is installed and use its <code>libtls</code> if available.
If it&rsquo;s not available,
it will detect if a <code>libtls</code> is available (<em>reyk@</em>&rsquo;s work, for example),
then if neither one is available it will build a dumbed down version that contains only what OpenSMTPD needs.
<strong>Using that version may not work on another project</strong>.
This has the benefit that <strong>LibreSSL is always prioritized</strong> if available,
while still allowing us to switch to <code>libtls</code> if it isn&rsquo;t.
This is not ideal as it adds complexity to the compat layer in OpenSMTPD,
but this complexity allows unlocking the <code>libtls</code> conversion which will considerably simplify OpenSMTPD itself,
so I think it is a fair choice.</p><p>The work to build that compat <code>libtls</code> is done and so is the conversion of OpenSMTPD to the <code>libtls</code> interface.
It is very invasive and, like any huge work, it has a potential for introducing regressions.
Given that there&rsquo;s only a few weeks before the next major release,
I won&rsquo;t merge this for the next major release but skip it so we have a full development cycle to spot shortcomings.</p><p>The next major release of OpenSMTPD,
version 6.7.0 due April/May,
will still use the <code>libssl</code> interface but later releases starting with version 6.8.0,
due October/November,
will use the <code>libtls</code> interface.</p><h2 id=implemented-multiple-feature-requests>Implemented multiple feature requests</h2><p>Building on top of my <code>libtls</code> work,
I have implemented several of the features that were requested and left pending waiting for the switch.
They are committed in separate branches and waiting for the <code>libtls</code> work to be merged:</p><ul><li>selectable ciphers per listener</li><li>selectable curves per listener</li><li>selectable TLS protocol version per listener</li><li>selectable SNI per listener (they&rsquo;re currently global)</li></ul><p>Other features are being worked on but not finished yet:</p><ul><li>OCSP check</li><li>certificate fingerprint verifications</li></ul><h2 id=started-documenting-the-filter-api>Started documenting the filter API</h2><p>I have also committed a <code>smtpd-filters(7)</code> man page,
which doesn&rsquo;t get installed yet,
that documents the protocol and events.</p><p>The feedback so far has been good and resulted in a few changes,
but having more people read it and comment would be nice.</p><h2 id=more-smtp-out-reporting-improvements>More <code>smtp-out</code> reporting improvements</h2><p>I discussed <code>smtp-out</code> reporting <a href=/posts/2019-12-24/december-2019-opensmtpd-and-filters-work-articles-and-goodies/>in my last report</a>,
but it wasn&rsquo;t finished and didn&rsquo;t cover all events.</p><p>I spent time to get this done so that we have events parity between <code>smtp-in</code> and <code>smtp-out</code>.
If you enable reporting for <code>smtp-in</code> and <code>smtp-out</code> then accept a mail for relaying,
you will first see the events happening from <code>smtp-in</code> as you accept the mail (server),
then see the same events from <code>smtp-out</code> as you relay the mail (client).</p><p>The message id and transaction id are preserved so that it is possible to track the path of an envelope through its entire life.</p><h2 id=what-next->What next ?</h2><p>I&rsquo;m contemplating <code>mda</code> reporting,
more on that in a future report.</p><p>I started learning Go by writing OpenSMTPD filters a few months ago and now I&rsquo;m learning Rust for other purposes.
Half-way through a book,
I will probably work on a real project to get my hands dirty.
I&rsquo;m unsure what that project will be yet as I have a few ideas in my sleeves,
but if I come up with anything valuable I&rsquo;ll share it.</p><p>I will write another article next week to discuss some work that could not make it into this report.</p><hr><p>Comments: <a href=https://github.com/poolpOrg/poolp.org/discussions/116>https://github.com/poolpOrg/poolp.org/discussions/116</a></p></div><div class="row PageNavigation d-flex justify-content-between font-weight-bold"><a class="d-block col-md-6" href=https://poolp.org/posts/2020-01-30/opensmtpd-advisory-dissected/>&#171; OpenSMTPD advisory dissected</a>
