Upon delivery today, I realized that they didn&amp;rsquo;t ship the correct one, but a 22 frets neck instead (see picture above). So while it still looks very nice, it&amp;rsquo;s not exacrly what I wanted, and it also doesn&amp;rsquo;t fit quite right in the body despite an announced compatible size: turns out that in guitar making, millimeters do matter.</description></item><item><title>Building my own guitar, part 1</title><link>https://poolp.org/posts/2023-06-28/building-my-own-guitar-part-1/</link><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jun 2023 13:42:00 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://poolp.org/posts/2023-06-28/building-my-own-guitar-part-1/</guid><description>TL;DR: I'm building a guitar from scratch, picking up every component but skipping the tricky cut and glue bits :-) About this project The primary goal of this project is to build a custom guitar, picking each and every component one by one, so that it&amp;rsquo;s 100% what I want it to be.
The second goal is to set myself a reasonnable objective, by not having to cut and glue wood myself, so that I can see if I like building guitars at all.</description></item><item><title>A new section appeared !</title><link>https://poolp.org/posts/2023-06-25/a-new-section-appeared/</link><pubDate>Sun, 25 Jun 2023 17:29:00 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://poolp.org/posts/2023-06-25/a-new-section-appeared/</guid><description>TL;DR: I will be discussing music on this blog from now on.

Why so calm ? As some of you know, I was diagnosed a few years ago with generalized anxiety disorder, panic disorder and alexithymia, a trait that makes it particularly difficult for me to cope with the disorders.
As I wrote in 2019, I didn&amp;rsquo;t take the alexithymia diagnosis too well.

This post won't need a TL;DR as I'll keep it short. Generalized anxiety disorder and alexithymia. Late 2018, I&amp;rsquo;ve been diagnosed with generalized anxiety disorder and alexithymia a couple weeks apart.
The anxiety disorder didn&amp;rsquo;t really come as a surprise as I know very well the traumatic experience that led to the disorder. It&amp;rsquo;ll still take a lot of hours of hypnosis to continue cleaning up trauma after trauma, but taking care of it and releasing some of the traumas has improved considerably my anxiety.</description></item><item><title>OpenSMTPD now supports regex in match rules</title><link>https://poolp.org/posts/2018-12-21/opensmtpd-now-supports-regex-in-match-rules/</link><pubDate>Fri, 21 Dec 2018 22:36:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://poolp.org/posts/2018-12-21/opensmtpd-now-supports-regex-in-match-rules/</guid><description>TL;DR: regex table lookups were introduced for builtin filters. After a few weeks of working solely on filters, I wanted to work on something else. Using the same mechanism, all match criterias using tables can support regex. K_REGEX lookups The table mechanism is used within OpenSMTPD to perform all kinds of lookups.
Recently, while working on builtin filters, I introduced the K_REGEX lookup type allowing tables to serve regex(3) patterns.</description></item><item><title>more on OpenSMTPD filters</title><link>https://poolp.org/posts/2018-12-19/more-on-opensmtpd-filters/</link><pubDate>Wed, 19 Dec 2018 18:21:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://poolp.org/posts/2018-12-19/more-on-opensmtpd-filters/</guid><description>TL;DR: Not this time, pal/gal, I took hours writing this post, you'll take a few minutes reading it all. Oh, and merry X-mas :-* A bit of short-sighted history The filtering feature has been introduced only recently in OpenSMTPD, first presented on this blog a month ago.

Let's focus a bit more on the reporting bits this time. The format is improving further and has extended to outgoing trafic reporting. Reporting In previous article, I described the events reporting mechanism that has been introduced in the development branch of OpenSMTPD.

I finally committed most of the filters code to OpenBSD. There is still a bit of work required but the trickiest parts are done. This article describes how filters are implemented and what to expect. OpenSMTPD 6.4.0 was released ! We have released OpenSMTPD 6.4.0 last week without filters.

The new config is also a new queue that is not backwards compatible. The easiest way is to flush the mail queue before switching. We came up with a solution to help maintainers of more complex setups. Switching from old config to new config The new OpenSMTPD configuration grammar is slightly different from the current one, rules are no longer stated as single lines, but the conversion from previous ruleset to new ruleset isn&amp;rsquo;t that hard.</description></item><item><title>OpenSMTPD new config</title><link>https://poolp.org/posts/2018-04-30/opensmtpd-new-config/</link><pubDate>Mon, 30 Apr 2018 12:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://poolp.org/posts/2018-04-30/opensmtpd-new-config/</guid><description>TL;DR: OpenBSD #p2k18 hackathon took place at Epitech in Nantes. I was organizing the hackathon but managed to make progress on OpenSMTPD. As mentionned at EuroBSDCon the one-line per rule config format was a design error. A new configuration grammar is almost ready and the underlying structures are simplified. Refactor removes ~750 lines of code and solves _many_ issues that were side-effects of the design error. New features are going to be unlocked thanks to this.</description></item><item><title>Install OpenBSD on dedibox with full-disk encryption</title><link>https://poolp.org/posts/2018-01-29/install-openbsd-on-dedibox-with-full-disk-encryption/</link><pubDate>Mon, 29 Jan 2018 23:28:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://poolp.org/posts/2018-01-29/install-openbsd-on-dedibox-with-full-disk-encryption/</guid><description>TL;DR: I run several &amp;quot;dedibox&amp;quot; servers at online.net, all powered by OpenBSD.

Aaron Poffenberger wrote a shell-based `spf_fetch` utility. I wrote a C-based `spfwalk` utility that's `pledge()`-ed. The `spfwalk` utility got merged to `smtpctl`. What&amp;rsquo;s SPF in a few words SPF is the Sender Policy Framework, a standard to verify the domain name of an e-mail sender.
Long story short, the SMTP protocol does not come with a way to authenticate a domain and, during an SMTP session, nothing really prevents a sender from pretending to come from any domain:</description></item><item><title>News from the front !</title><link>https://poolp.org/posts/2018-01-08/news-from-the-front/</link><pubDate>Mon, 08 Jan 2018 12:11:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://poolp.org/posts/2018-01-08/news-from-the-front/</guid><description>TL;DR: Came very close to a burn out late 2016, had to quit former employer.

Turns out most of the changes are not visible. A featureless release I managed to wrap the 6.0.0 release yesterday.
Unlike most of our releases, it comes out with almost no new feature.
The changelog fits in less than 10 lines as follows:
- new fork+reexec model so each process has its own randomized memory space - logging format has been reworked - a &amp;quot;multi-line response&amp;quot; bug in the LMTP delivery backend has been fixed - connections concurrency limits have been bumped - artificial delaying in remote sessions have been reduced - dhparams option has been removed - dhe option has been added, supporting auto and legacy modes - smtp engine has been simplified - various cosmethic changes, code cleanup and documentation improvement Seems like a very productive slacking, however some of these changes turn out to be very interesting in terms of code simplification and security.</description></item><item><title>Home, sweet home</title><link>https://poolp.org/posts/2015-12-22/home-sweet-home/</link><pubDate>Tue, 22 Dec 2015 09:53:01 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://poolp.org/posts/2015-12-22/home-sweet-home/</guid><description>TL;DR: OpenSMTPD on github no longer diverges from OpenBSD. Since last episode Sometime this year, we released OpenSMTPD 5.7.1 which was the first version that shipped with the long-awaited experimental filters support. The result of over a year and a half of very very deep refactor in our IO layer and the addition of a very elegant but also very tricky new API.
This refactor took place outside the OpenBSD tree because it required breaking a lot of code for extended period of times, which spanned over 3 OpenBSD releases.</description></item><item><title>The state of filters</title><link>https://poolp.org/posts/2014-12-12/the-state-of-filters/</link><pubDate>Fri, 12 Dec 2014 16:56:24 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://poolp.org/posts/2014-12-12/the-state-of-filters/</guid><description>TL;DR: yeeeees, filters are coming. don't believe us ? here's an example. be patient. On my death bed On my death bed, when my life flashes before my eyes and I start recalling what people have told me during my (hopefully long) lifetime, these sentences will single out:
&amp;ldquo;When will OpenSMTPD support filters ? I need it.&amp;rdquo;
Not that it carries a philosophical meaning that will have taken me a lifetime of thinking, but because for the last three years I have been hearing this every time I met someone IRL and discussed OpenSMTPD, I have read it on our Github issues tracker, on GTalk, on IRC, on Twitter, on Facebook, on random forums, and just this week three times in my mailbox.</description></item><item><title>Some OpenSMTPD overview, part 3</title><link>https://poolp.org/posts/2014-12-10/some-opensmtpd-overview-part-3/</link><pubDate>Wed, 10 Dec 2014 12:38:26 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://poolp.org/posts/2014-12-10/some-opensmtpd-overview-part-3/</guid><description>EHLO,
This is the third post of a series about OpenSMTPD improvements that have taken place since this summer.
Content altering For a long time, we have developed OpenSMTPD with a strict rule that the daemon should not alter DATA (as in the DATA SMTP phase) in any way.
The rationale was that by enforcing that rule, the message writing was simplified as the smtp process would simply read data from a client and write it, without any post-processing, to a file descriptor.</description></item><item><title>Some OpenSMTPD overview, part 2</title><link>https://poolp.org/posts/2014-12-01/some-opensmtpd-overview-part-2/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Dec 2014 09:04:11 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://poolp.org/posts/2014-12-01/some-opensmtpd-overview-part-2/</guid><description>Why we killed the MFA (filter) process For as long as I can remember, a process called MFA was created by OpenSMTPD at start time.
MFA stood for &amp;ldquo;Mail Filter Agent&amp;rdquo; and the goal of that process was initially to take care of all filtering tasks ranging from filtering senders based on the ruleset matching to starting and controlling filters.
As time passed by, we figured the lookup process was better suited for ruleset matching and the MFA process became mostly idle, we renamed it to &amp;ldquo;filter&amp;rdquo; process since the only thing it had to do was take care of starting filters and making sure they had the proper environment.</description></item><item><title>Some OpenSMTPD overview, part 1</title><link>https://poolp.org/posts/2014-11-26/some-opensmtpd-overview-part-1/</link><pubDate>Wed, 26 Nov 2014 14:25:12 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://poolp.org/posts/2014-11-26/some-opensmtpd-overview-part-1/</guid><description>EHLO world ! Yesterday I thought I&amp;rsquo;d write a first OpenSMTPD-related post to sum up the changes that have happened since this summer but it turned out to be painful as they amount to quite a lot. Instead, I think a better strategy is to split this into a serie of smaller posts focused on the specific changes ;-)
So, in June I have organized a mini hackathon at my brand new place and invited some of the French Connection at home.</description></item><item><title>what the fsck did just happen</title><link>https://poolp.org/posts/2014-11-24/what-the-fsck-did-just-happen/</link><pubDate>Mon, 24 Nov 2014 18:01:51 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://poolp.org/posts/2014-11-24/what-the-fsck-did-just-happen/</guid><description>Good news everyone !
With last post dating from almost a year, we can all agree that I&amp;rsquo;ve outpassed my slacking skills by a great margin and I probably deserve an award of some kind ;-)
Anyways, there&amp;rsquo;s been a few complaints during these 12 months because this blog was the main source of information for the OpenSMTPD project and several posts which used to describe features and configuration samples had suddenly disappeared.</description></item><item><title>News-from-the-front</title><link>https://poolp.org/posts/2013-12-14/news-from-the-front/</link><pubDate>Sat, 14 Dec 2013 21:36:40 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://poolp.org/posts/2013-12-14/news-from-the-front/</guid><description>EHLO readers,
This blog post is the first since a few months, I&amp;rsquo;ve been busy and struggling with some personal health and familial issues. I won&amp;rsquo;t share them here as its not really something anyone can help with, so&amp;hellip; let&amp;rsquo;s focus on OpenSMTPD !
What happened since last post
When I wrote the last blog post, we had just released 5.3.2 which was a minor release that fixed a few non-critical bugs that were reported to us since the first major release a few months earlier.</description></item><item><title>OpenSMTPD improvements summary</title><link>https://poolp.org/posts/2013-12-14/opensmtpd-improvements-summary/</link><pubDate>Sat, 14 Dec 2013 21:36:40 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://poolp.org/posts/2013-12-14/opensmtpd-improvements-summary/</guid><description>Hey,
No OpenSMTPD news since almost a month&amp;hellip; time to break the trend !
As far as I&amp;rsquo;m concerned, I&amp;rsquo;ve been busy with other work but still a git log shows that between Eric and I we have accumulated quite a few things during this month. Below is a short non-exhaustive summary of changes and news.
All of it is already pushed to our Github mirror and part of the snapshots that were published yesterday.</description></item><item><title>Installer OpenBSD sur une dedibox Classic+ Gen2</title><link>https://poolp.org/posts/2013-05-08/installer-openbsd-sur-une-dedibox-classic-gen2/</link><pubDate>Wed, 08 May 2013 14:23:43 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://poolp.org/posts/2013-05-08/installer-openbsd-sur-une-dedibox-classic-gen2/</guid><description>Yop,

This week has been very productive with several tickets closed and more about to be closed.
Eric has done an amazing work as you will soon realize ;-)
I will push to our Github mirror and publish a snapshot this week-end very likely, until then don&amp;rsquo;t look for the features, only we have them !
Compressed and Encrypted queue
While working on bringing back encrypted queue support, I ran into a couple issues.</description></item><item><title>News from the front</title><link>https://poolp.org/posts/2013-04-21/news-from-the-front/</link><pubDate>Sun, 21 Apr 2013 17:15:21 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://poolp.org/posts/2013-04-21/news-from-the-front/</guid><description>OHAI,
I have not updated this blog since the release of OpenSMTPD 5.3, over a month ago. In the meantime, some minor bugs have been fixed and we have released OpenSMTPD 5.3.1.
The main reason for the silence is that I was busy with completely unrelated day-time work, unrelated opensource code, the OpenSMTPD book in progress and some minor health issues that have caused endless side-effects keeping my mind away from this blog.</description></item><item><title>OpenSMTPD 5.3 released</title><link>https://poolp.org/posts/2013-03-17/opensmtpd-5.3-released/</link><pubDate>Sun, 17 Mar 2013 19:08:55 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://poolp.org/posts/2013-03-17/opensmtpd-5.3-released/</guid><description>OHAI !
I&amp;rsquo;ve stayed silent for the last month as we got ready for the big thing&amp;hellip;
Charles, Eric and I are proud to announce the release of OpenSMTPD 5.3, our first official production-ready release !
OpenSMTPD has been in use at poolp.org since 2008 and these last five years have seen a considerable amount of work. At various times we have been contemplating a release then delaying to add that one thing that seemed essential.</description></item><item><title>OpenSMTPD: minor fixes + preparing release</title><link>https://poolp.org/posts/2013-02-02/opensmtpd-minor-fixes--preparing-release/</link><pubDate>Sat, 02 Feb 2013 12:54:36 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://poolp.org/posts/2013-02-02/opensmtpd-minor-fixes--preparing-release/</guid><description>OHAI,
We had planned to slow down a bit to prepare for release: no more feature, no more invasive changes until we tag something out of which we can publish a release. I then discussed with Bret Lambert (blambert@) and he asked me if we used some kind of code scanner to detect defects in our code.
We do use the clang static analyzer every now and then, the last time being a couple week ago, and we spend a few minutes cleaning up the defects we believe to be real issues.</description></item><item><title>OpenSMTPD: gentlemen, fasten your seatbelt</title><link>https://poolp.org/posts/2013-01-25/opensmtpd-gentlemen-fasten-your-seatbelt/</link><pubDate>Fri, 25 Jan 2013 23:01:47 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://poolp.org/posts/2013-01-25/opensmtpd-gentlemen-fasten-your-seatbelt/</guid><description>OHAI,
Lately we have stabilized and decided that we&amp;rsquo;re okay with the features we have for our first release, this time for good, so we focused on making sure that we didn&amp;rsquo;t introduce regressions and that we were rock solid.
We stressed incoming and outgoing path and found areas of improvements. This will be a long-standing task, but we have already improved memory usage considerably under high-load, we&amp;rsquo;re pretty happy with the result.</description></item><item><title>OpenSMTPD: stress and features</title><link>https://poolp.org/posts/2013-01-18/opensmtpd-stress-and-features/</link><pubDate>Fri, 18 Jan 2013 22:11:07 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://poolp.org/posts/2013-01-18/opensmtpd-stress-and-features/</guid><description>&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Hey,&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt; I wanted to publish something last Friday but I unfortunately got my hands on a copy of Super Nintendo's Zelda which led to an instant loss of motivation.
Here's a quick summary of what happened recently in OpenSMTPD-land, it's not an exhaustive description and to be honest I'm keeping a lot of information private at this point and probably until release ;-)
A snapshot should be published tomorrow.

I know I should have posted a &amp;ldquo;Happy New Year&amp;rdquo; note earlier but you know how it is: new year eve&amp;rsquo;s aftermath, days to recover, work resumes, mood slacks, bleh.
Anyway, today&amp;rsquo;s note is simply about that: wishing you and me an awesome year 2013 and hoping you will not turn it into a fucking mess. After all, you&amp;rsquo;re in charge so we know who to blame ;-)
As far as I&amp;rsquo;m concerned, year 2012 wasn&amp;rsquo;t &amp;ldquo;great&amp;rdquo;, it was not the absolute suck either, it was even quite decent.</description></item><item><title>OpenSMTPD: SSL &amp; relay stuff</title><link>https://poolp.org/posts/2012-12-28/opensmtpd-ssl-relay-stuff/</link><pubDate>Fri, 28 Dec 2012 20:11:23 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://poolp.org/posts/2012-12-28/opensmtpd-ssl-relay-stuff/</guid><description>OHAI,
I was unable to write a story last week as my desk broke into pieces for no apparent reason but my foot hitting it accidentally.
I still don&amp;rsquo;t have a desk so I will make this short by not telling about the queue profiling and SQL log conversion I wrote, and not even writing about the filter work done by Eric, he&amp;rsquo;ll write about it if he wants to or I&amp;rsquo;ll do that next time.</description></item><item><title>OpenSMTPD: LDAP support, selectable source, DKIM and Goodies</title><link>https://poolp.org/posts/2012-12-14/opensmtpd-ldap-support-selectable-source-dkim-and-goodies/</link><pubDate>Fri, 14 Dec 2012 21:43:44 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://poolp.org/posts/2012-12-14/opensmtpd-ldap-support-selectable-source-dkim-and-goodies/</guid><description>&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;OHAI,&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt; This week has been crazy, my brain melted a little as I worked on filters, it melted a little as I worked on LDAP and it melted a little more as I tried to trick Eric into working on filters with me (yes, that actually worked :-).
Anyway, as usual, this is just going to be a summary of what we did as tons of little stuff have been committed here and there.</description></item><item><title>OpenSMTPD: fully virtual setups, updated DNS &amp; MTA code, SQLite support</title><link>https://poolp.org/posts/2012-12-07/opensmtpd-fully-virtual-setups-updated-dns-mta-code-sqlite-support/</link><pubDate>Fri, 07 Dec 2012 21:17:57 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://poolp.org/posts/2012-12-07/opensmtpd-fully-virtual-setups-updated-dns-mta-code-sqlite-support/</guid><description>OHAI,
This week I had intended to work on filters. After 3 days of pain and swearing, even though it did move forward, I finally decided to step back for a few days and work on something else to preserve my sanity.
As you may have guessed, this week has not been too productive&amp;hellip; Oh wait, yes it has ! It&amp;rsquo;s actually been incredibly productive :-)
Just as usual, I will only write a summary for this week, the complete changelog can be retrieved from our mirror on Github.</description></item><item><title>OpenSMTPD: more features, more cleanup, more more</title><link>https://poolp.org/posts/2012-11-30/opensmtpd-more-features-more-cleanup-more-more/</link><pubDate>Fri, 30 Nov 2012 22:13:25 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://poolp.org/posts/2012-11-30/opensmtpd-more-features-more-cleanup-more-more/</guid><description>OHAI,
First of all, on a completely unrelated note, I&amp;rsquo;d like to emphasize that this blog post is being written from my text editor launched by a little shell and pushed to poolp using the Ocean API. I can be web2.0 from console and emacs, and that&amp;rsquo;s definitely worth a mention ;-)
As has become a habit, a lot of work has been poured in OpenSMTPD this week, here is an incomplete summary of the most notable changes.</description></item><item><title>News from the front</title><link>https://poolp.org/posts/2012-11-17/news-from-the-front/</link><pubDate>Sat, 17 Nov 2012 13:28:58 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://poolp.org/posts/2012-11-17/news-from-the-front/</guid><description>Almost a month since my last post&amp;hellip; I know, I know.
So I left my position at Scality two weeks ago. I had been there for a year and a half working on a very interesting and tricky project. I will miss my colleagues and the discussions we had on all kinds of topic, I hope them the best future and that we will be able to share beers again ;-)</description></item><item><title>OpenSMTPD: crypto/compress fixes and import initial stab at LDAP</title><link>https://poolp.org/posts/2012-08-31/opensmtpd-crypto/compress-fixes-and-import-initial-stab-at-ldap/</link><pubDate>Fri, 31 Aug 2012 15:21:39 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://poolp.org/posts/2012-08-31/opensmtpd-crypto/compress-fixes-and-import-initial-stab-at-ldap/</guid><description>The crypto backend that has been committed a couple days ago started a little discussion and it was decided to switch the default cipher from Blowfish to AES-128 and make it a default.
Encryption can now be enabled as simply as:
queue encryption key &amp;ldquo;foobar&amp;rdquo;
That being said, Charles cleaned up a bit the compression code to make it use FILE* instead of file descriptors. This allows us to ensure we don&amp;rsquo;t have to deal with any buffering and interruption handling code.</description></item><item><title>OpenSMTPD: crypto_backend and encrypted queue</title><link>https://poolp.org/posts/2012-08-29/opensmtpd-crypto_backend-and-encrypted-queue/</link><pubDate>Wed, 29 Aug 2012 10:21:59 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://poolp.org/posts/2012-08-29/opensmtpd-crypto_backend-and-encrypted-queue/</guid><description>A few days ago, Charles committed the compress_backend API which allowed transparent deflation/inflation of envelopes and messages as they hit the queue.
The compression code is executed before the queue_backend gets the data so that any queue_backend can benefit transparently from compression without having to add any code to handle it. Due to our design, this also means that if the queue_backend stores envelopes and messages remotely, then the compression will take place before sending and after fetching, the remote end only ever sees compressed data.</description></item><item><title>OpenSMTPD: I have no idea for that title, sorry</title><link>https://poolp.org/posts/2012-08-26/opensmtpd-i-have-no-idea-for-that-title-sorry/</link><pubDate>Sun, 26 Aug 2012 22:53:03 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://poolp.org/posts/2012-08-26/opensmtpd-i-have-no-idea-for-that-title-sorry/</guid><description>Howdie,
Eric and I had planned a loooooong time ago to have a hackathon this week-end. However, some asshole piece of shit ran into my car while it was parked, made it unable to take the road and flee without leaving a note. Long story made short, I had to be at the repair shop this week-end to be able to get my car before end of September.
We did get our hackathon though and while it was probably much less productive than if we had met in the same room, it was still very very interesting with tons of improvements and many great features written :-p</description></item><item><title>OpenSMTPD: plenty of news</title><link>https://poolp.org/posts/2012-08-21/opensmtpd-plenty-of-news/</link><pubDate>Tue, 21 Aug 2012 22:22:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://poolp.org/posts/2012-08-21/opensmtpd-plenty-of-news/</guid><description>It&amp;rsquo;s been over a month since my last post but I have an excuse: I was super busy, then I was super on vacation &amp;hellip; but I&amp;rsquo;m back again ;-)
So my life was pretty intense these last few weeks, both professionnally and on the opensource front. I&amp;rsquo;ll explain later, for now let&amp;rsquo;s just focus on the OpenSMTPD goodies.
OpenSMTPD portable to a new system First of all, I&amp;rsquo;d like to stress out that Rune Lynge and Charles Longeau did an amazing job at porting OpenSMTPD to yet another system &amp;hellip; MacOSX.</description></item><item><title>g2k12: OpenBSD hackathon - part II</title><link>https://poolp.org/posts/2012-07-15/g2k12-openbsd-hackathon-part-ii/</link><pubDate>Sun, 15 Jul 2012 21:43:58 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://poolp.org/posts/2012-07-15/g2k12-openbsd-hackathon-part-ii/</guid><description>Yesterday, I came back from Budapest and was too tired to write anything, but here&amp;rsquo;s a quick summary of all the features that have been implemented with regard to OpenSMTPD by Eric, Charles and I.
First of all, Eric [eric@] has moved ASR, his asynchronous resolver, to OpenBSD&amp;rsquo;s libc. This is a huge step forward that will allow OpenSMTPD to contain less code, while providing a better coverage of the resolver code.</description></item><item><title>g2k12: OpenBSD hackathon</title><link>https://poolp.org/posts/2012-07-09/g2k12-openbsd-hackathon/</link><pubDate>Mon, 09 Jul 2012 23:52:31 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://poolp.org/posts/2012-07-09/g2k12-openbsd-hackathon/</guid><description>Yesterday, after nearly missing my plane by 5 minutes, I finally managed to make it to Budapest for g2k12, the OpenBSD general hackathon.
While this is not my first hackathon, this is the first general one with many hackers working on all kinds of subsystems ranging from ports to network and kernel. It&amp;rsquo;s fun to see many people focused on improving different areas which you use daily, sometimes without even noticing, and doing it with as much fun as you are having fixing your own area ;-)</description></item><item><title>OpenSMTPD: development, bug tracker &amp; GitHub</title><link>https://poolp.org/posts/2012-06-19/opensmtpd-development-bug-tracker-github/</link><pubDate>Tue, 19 Jun 2012 19:57:37 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://poolp.org/posts/2012-06-19/opensmtpd-development-bug-tracker-github/</guid><description>It&amp;rsquo;s been a while since my last post about OpenSMTPD.
I don&amp;rsquo;t know what Eric and Charles have been up to, I was quite busy with my daytime job and couldn&amp;rsquo;t really spend much time on the hobby ;-)
Anyways, one of the most requested feature of OpenSMTPD is to provide users with a mean to report bugs and let them contribute more easily. It&amp;rsquo;s been requested two times this week, it&amp;rsquo;s been requested countless times in the last few weeks and months, and as a matter of fact it&amp;rsquo;s also been a nuisance for us as until now we&amp;rsquo;ve kept track of bugs and feature requests in my mailbox.</description></item><item><title>OpenSMTPD REST queue</title><link>https://poolp.org/posts/2012-06-06/opensmtpd-rest-queue/</link><pubDate>Wed, 06 Jun 2012 14:44:10 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://poolp.org/posts/2012-06-06/opensmtpd-rest-queue/</guid><description>This is the first post of a series to illustrate and describe a &amp;ldquo;proof of concept&amp;rdquo; code by Charles, Eric and I. I will describe the features as they are implemented.
Since mid-November 2011, OpenSMTPD offers support for an extensible queue API. The queue_backend API allows a developer to write a custom storage driver by implementing a small set of functions that take care of storing, updating and removing envelopes and messages.</description></item><item><title>OpenSMTPD: src-address maps and spamhaus</title><link>https://poolp.org/posts/2012-05-17/opensmtpd-src-address-maps-and-spamhaus/</link><pubDate>Thu, 17 May 2012 17:23:09 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://poolp.org/posts/2012-05-17/opensmtpd-src-address-maps-and-spamhaus/</guid><description>First of all, I&amp;rsquo;d like to &amp;ldquo;thank&amp;rdquo; The Spamhaus project which forced me into hacking this feature in a hurry.
See, I rent a server at online.net which I use for OpenSMTPD live testing and to run some experimental code before it hits the OpenBSD tree.
Yesterday I received a mail from a user complaining that he couldn&amp;rsquo;t send mail to a friend because we were listed on spamhaus. That was very strange because ALL users at poolp.</description></item><item><title>OpenSMTPD relay maps &amp; new url syntax</title><link>https://poolp.org/posts/2012-05-14/opensmtpd-relay-maps-new-url-syntax/</link><pubDate>Mon, 14 May 2012 09:55:52 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://poolp.org/posts/2012-05-14/opensmtpd-relay-maps-new-url-syntax/</guid><description>When we first started working on OpenSMTPD, we planned for future features but we did not necessarily start integrating them right away as the goal was to bootstrap the project first with basic features.
Amongst these features was the ability to use mappings for outgoing MX servers. Currently, OpenSMTPD knows two ways of going out:
Using the DNS system to find MX records: accept for [&amp;hellip;] relay
Using the provided mail exchanger: accept for [&amp;hellip;] relay via &amp;ldquo;my-mx.</description></item><item><title>OpenSMTPD, map_compare() and K_NETADDR</title><link>https://poolp.org/posts/2012-05-13/opensmtpd-map_compare-and-k_netaddr/</link><pubDate>Sun, 13 May 2012 03:09:16 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://poolp.org/posts/2012-05-13/opensmtpd-map_compare-and-k_netaddr/</guid><description>Ok, I already posted about the new SQLite map_backend earlier today but it turns out that I&amp;rsquo;ve been very productive, and it was worth another post ;-)
So I decided to start improving our maps support and make them usable from places where they weren&amp;rsquo;t.
primary domains
OpenSMTPD supports two kinds of domains: primary domains and virtual domains. The primary domains do not require providing a list of recipients as it will use system accounts; whereas virtual domains require a list of recipients and/or a fallback address to be provided within a map.</description></item><item><title>OpenSMTPD meets SQLite</title><link>https://poolp.org/posts/2012-05-12/opensmtpd-meets-sqlite/</link><pubDate>Sat, 12 May 2012 14:23:54 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://poolp.org/posts/2012-05-12/opensmtpd-meets-sqlite/</guid><description>During the r2k12 hackathon in Paris, Marc Espie committed SQLite to OpenBSD&amp;rsquo;s base system.
This has the side effect that OpenSMTPD can start using it and while we agreed that we did not want it as a strong dependency, the various backends API allow us to make it a soft dependency that can be removed without breaking the daemon if someone really does not want SQLite linked.
Today I decided to give it a try and implement a SQLite backend to the map API.</description></item><item><title>Some OpenSMTPD news</title><link>https://poolp.org/posts/2012-05-09/some-opensmtpd-news/</link><pubDate>Wed, 09 May 2012 23:03:36 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://poolp.org/posts/2012-05-09/some-opensmtpd-news/</guid><description>It&amp;rsquo;s been a whiiiiiiile since my last OpenSMTPD related post. Time to break the slacking, blog-wise.
Unlike what would appear from the outside, there&amp;rsquo;s been a lot of activity, discussions and planning, I&amp;rsquo;ll address some here and will discuss it further soon.
First of all, chl@ has committed to a private branch a major improvement to the filter API: async DNS lookups. Due to the design of OpenSMTPD, it is not acceptable for a filter to perform a blocking call as it will prevent it from processing other sessions.</description></item><item><title>fatigue et envie de vacances...</title><link>https://poolp.org/posts/2005-05-21/fatigue-et-envie-de-vacances.../</link><pubDate>Sat, 21 May 2005 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://poolp.org/posts/2005-05-21/fatigue-et-envie-de-vacances.../</guid><description>Je sais pas pourquoi, mais je suis epuise alors que j&amp;rsquo;ai dormi pres de 14h cette nuit. J&amp;rsquo;ai envie de faire une pause, de me prendre une annee de vacances au bord de la plage les doigts de pieds dans le sable fin blanc pendant qu&amp;rsquo;on me sert du sorbet a la noix de coco sur fond de Gojira alors que le soleil me rechauffe le visage mais juste un peu, pas trop, voila, comme ca, merci.</description></item></channel></rss>
