This post won't need a TL;DR as I'll keep it short. Generalized anxiety disorder and alexithymia. Late 2018, I&rsquo;ve been diagnosed with generalized anxiety disorder and alexithymia a couple weeks apart.
The anxiety disorder didn&rsquo;t really come as a surprise as I know very well the traumatic experience that led to the disorder. It&rsquo;ll still take a lot of hours of hypnosis to continue cleaning up trauma after trauma, but taking care of it and releasing some of the traumas has improved considerably my anxiety.</div></a><a class="article block px-3 py-4 hover:bg-slate-200 dark:hover:bg-slate-700" href=/posts/2018-12-21/opensmtpd-now-supports-regex-in-match-rules/><h3 class="text-lg font-semibold mb-0.5">OpenSMTPD now supports regex in match rules</h3><div class="text-sm text-slate-500 dark:text-slate-400 line-clamp-2">TL;DR: regex table lookups were introduced for builtin filters. After a few weeks of working solely on filters, I wanted to work on something else. Using the same mechanism, all match criterias using tables can support regex. K_REGEX lookups The table mechanism is used within OpenSMTPD to perform all kinds of lookups.
Recently, while working on builtin filters, I introduced the K_REGEX lookup type allowing tables to serve regex(3) patterns.</div></a><a class="article block px-3 py-4 hover:bg-slate-200 dark:hover:bg-slate-700" href=/posts/2018-12-19/more-on-opensmtpd-filters/><h3 class="text-lg font-semibold mb-0.5">more on OpenSMTPD filters</h3><div class="text-sm text-slate-500 dark:text-slate-400 line-clamp-2">TL;DR: Not this time, pal/gal, I took hours writing this post, you'll take a few minutes reading it all. Oh, and merry X-mas :-* A bit of short-sighted history The filtering feature has been introduced only recently in OpenSMTPD, first presented on this blog a month ago.
I had a working proof-of-concept running on my laptop and my plan was to start bringing the code to the OpenBSD tree, small chunks by small chunks, through a serie of diffs.</div></a><a class="article block px-3 py-4 hover:bg-slate-200 dark:hover:bg-slate-700" href=/posts/2018-12-06/opensmtpd-proc-filters-fc-rdns/><h3 class="text-lg font-semibold mb-0.5">OpenSMTPD proc filters & fc-rDNS</h3><div class="text-sm text-slate-500 dark:text-slate-400 line-clamp-2">TL;DR: I *FINALFUCKINGLY* commited proc filters support allowing full filtering in OpenSMTPD. eric@ implemented fc-rDNS lookups. fc-rDNS fc-rDNS, or forward-confirmed reverse DNS, consists in performing a reverse DNS lookup to determine the hostname associated to an IP address&mldr; then performing a DNS lookup on that hostname to check if it resolves back to the IP address.
On my request, eric@ implemented fc-rDNS lookups in our SMTP engine, causing OpenSMTPD to perform the double lookup upon clients connections.</div></a><a class="article block px-3 py-4 hover:bg-slate-200 dark:hover:bg-slate-700" href=/posts/2018-11-09/opensmtpd-reporting-update/><h3 class="text-lg font-semibold mb-0.5">OpenSMTPD reporting update</h3><div class="text-sm text-slate-500 dark:text-slate-400 line-clamp-2">TL;DR: The reporting mechanism has been described shortly in my previous article about both reporting and filters. Let's focus a bit more on the reporting bits this time. The format is improving further and has extended to outgoing trafic reporting. Reporting In previous article, I described the events reporting mechanism that has been introduced in the development branch of OpenSMTPD.
To sum it up, you could now write an event processor as simple as a shell script reading its stdin on a loop:</div></a><a class="article block px-3 py-4 hover:bg-slate-200 dark:hover:bg-slate-700" href=/posts/2018-11-03/opensmtpd-released-and-upcoming-filters-preview/><h3 class="text-lg font-semibold mb-0.5">OpenSMTPD released and upcoming filters preview</h3><div class="text-sm text-slate-500 dark:text-slate-400 line-clamp-2">TL;DR: Filters have been a (the most ?) long awaited feature in OpenSMTPD. I finally committed most of the filters code to OpenBSD. There is still a bit of work required but the trickiest parts are done. This article describes how filters are implemented and what to expect. OpenSMTPD 6.4.0 was released ! We have released OpenSMTPD 6.4.0 last week without filters.
I won&rsquo;t expand on the features in the 6.</div></a><a class="article block px-3 py-4 hover:bg-slate-200 dark:hover:bg-slate-700" href=/posts/2018-05-21/switching-to-opensmtpd-new-config/><h3 class="text-lg font-semibold mb-0.5">switching to OpenSMTPD new config</h3><div class="text-sm text-slate-500 dark:text-slate-400 line-clamp-2">TL;DR: Switching to new config is not too hard and can be done in minutes. The new config is also a new queue that is not backwards compatible. The easiest way is to flush the mail queue before switching. We came up with a solution to help maintainers of more complex setups. Switching from old config to new config The new OpenSMTPD configuration grammar is slightly different from the current one, rules are no longer stated as single lines, but the conversion from previous ruleset to new ruleset isn&rsquo;t that hard.</div></a><a class="article block px-3 py-4 hover:bg-slate-200 dark:hover:bg-slate-700" href=/posts/2018-04-30/opensmtpd-new-config/><h3 class="text-lg font-semibold mb-0.5">OpenSMTPD new config</h3><div class="text-sm text-slate-500 dark:text-slate-400 line-clamp-2">TL;DR: OpenBSD #p2k18 hackathon took place at Epitech in Nantes. I was organizing the hackathon but managed to make progress on OpenSMTPD. As mentionned at EuroBSDCon the one-line per rule config format was a design error. A new configuration grammar is almost ready and the underlying structures are simplified. Refactor removes ~750 lines of code and solves _many_ issues that were side-effects of the design error. New features are going to be unlocked thanks to this.</div></a><a class="article block px-3 py-4 hover:bg-slate-200 dark:hover:bg-slate-700" href=/posts/2018-01-29/install-openbsd-on-dedibox-with-full-disk-encryption/><h3 class="text-lg font-semibold mb-0.5">Install OpenBSD on dedibox with full-disk encryption</h3><div class="text-sm text-slate-500 dark:text-slate-400 line-clamp-2">TL;DR: I run several "dedibox" servers at online.net, all powered by OpenBSD.

Aaron Poffenberger wrote a shell-based `spf_fetch` utility. I wrote a C-based `spfwalk` utility that's `pledge()`-ed. The `spfwalk` utility got merged to `smtpctl`. What&rsquo;s SPF in a few words SPF is the Sender Policy Framework, a standard to verify the domain name of an e-mail sender.
Long story short, the SMTP protocol does not come with a way to authenticate a domain and, during an SMTP session, nothing really prevents a sender from pretending to come from any domain:</div></a><a class="article block px-3 py-4 hover:bg-slate-200 dark:hover:bg-slate-700" href=/posts/2018-01-08/news-from-the-front/><h3 class="text-lg font-semibold mb-0.5">News from the front !</h3><div class="text-sm text-slate-500 dark:text-slate-400 line-clamp-2">TL;DR: Came very close to a burn out late 2016, had to quit former employer.

Turns out most of the changes are not visible. A featureless release I managed to wrap the 6.0.0 release yesterday.
Unlike most of our releases, it comes out with almost no new feature.
The changelog fits in less than 10 lines as follows:
- new fork+reexec model so each process has its own randomized memory space - logging format has been reworked - a "multi-line response" bug in the LMTP delivery backend has been fixed - connections concurrency limits have been bumped - artificial delaying in remote sessions have been reduced - dhparams option has been removed - dhe option has been added, supporting auto and legacy modes - smtp engine has been simplified - various cosmethic changes, code cleanup and documentation improvement Seems like a very productive slacking, however some of these changes turn out to be very interesting in terms of code simplification and security.</div></a><a class="article block px-3 py-4 hover:bg-slate-200 dark:hover:bg-slate-700" href=/posts/2015-12-22/home-sweet-home/><h3 class="text-lg font-semibold mb-0.5">Home, sweet home</h3><div class="text-sm text-slate-500 dark:text-slate-400 line-clamp-2">TL;DR: OpenSMTPD on github no longer diverges from OpenBSD. Since last episode Sometime this year, we released OpenSMTPD 5.7.1 which was the first version that shipped with the long-awaited experimental filters support. The result of over a year and a half of very very deep refactor in our IO layer and the addition of a very elegant but also very tricky new API.
This refactor took place outside the OpenBSD tree because it required breaking a lot of code for extended period of times, which spanned over 3 OpenBSD releases.</div></a><a class="article block px-3 py-4 hover:bg-slate-200 dark:hover:bg-slate-700" href=/posts/2014-12-12/the-state-of-filters/><h3 class="text-lg font-semibold mb-0.5">The state of filters</h3><div class="text-sm text-slate-500 dark:text-slate-400 line-clamp-2">TL;DR: yeeeees, filters are coming. don't believe us ? here's an example. be patient. On my death bed On my death bed, when my life flashes before my eyes and I start recalling what people have told me during my (hopefully long) lifetime, these sentences will single out:
&ldquo;When will OpenSMTPD support filters ? I need it.&rdquo;
Not that it carries a philosophical meaning that will have taken me a lifetime of thinking, but because for the last three years I have been hearing this every time I met someone IRL and discussed OpenSMTPD, I have read it on our Github issues tracker, on GTalk, on IRC, on Twitter, on Facebook, on random forums, and just this week three times in my mailbox.</div></a><a class="article block px-3 py-4 hover:bg-slate-200 dark:hover:bg-slate-700" href=/posts/2014-12-10/some-opensmtpd-overview-part-3/><h3 class="text-lg font-semibold mb-0.5">Some OpenSMTPD overview, part 3</h3><div class="text-sm text-slate-500 dark:text-slate-400 line-clamp-2">EHLO,
This is the third post of a series about OpenSMTPD improvements that have taken place since this summer.
Content altering For a long time, we have developed OpenSMTPD with a strict rule that the daemon should not alter DATA (as in the DATA SMTP phase) in any way.
The rationale was that by enforcing that rule, the message writing was simplified as the smtp process would simply read data from a client and write it, without any post-processing, to a file descriptor.</div></a><a class="article block px-3 py-4 hover:bg-slate-200 dark:hover:bg-slate-700" href=/posts/2014-12-01/some-opensmtpd-overview-part-2/><h3 class="text-lg font-semibold mb-0.5">Some OpenSMTPD overview, part 2</h3><div class="text-sm text-slate-500 dark:text-slate-400 line-clamp-2">Why we killed the MFA (filter) process For as long as I can remember, a process called MFA was created by OpenSMTPD at start time.
MFA stood for &ldquo;Mail Filter Agent&rdquo; and the goal of that process was initially to take care of all filtering tasks ranging from filtering senders based on the ruleset matching to starting and controlling filters.
As time passed by, we figured the lookup process was better suited for ruleset matching and the MFA process became mostly idle, we renamed it to &ldquo;filter&rdquo; process since the only thing it had to do was take care of starting filters and making sure they had the proper environment.</div></a><a class="article block px-3 py-4 hover:bg-slate-200 dark:hover:bg-slate-700" href=/posts/2014-11-26/some-opensmtpd-overview-part-1/><h3 class="text-lg font-semibold mb-0.5">Some OpenSMTPD overview, part 1</h3><div class="text-sm text-slate-500 dark:text-slate-400 line-clamp-2">EHLO world ! Yesterday I thought I&rsquo;d write a first OpenSMTPD-related post to sum up the changes that have happened since this summer but it turned out to be painful as they amount to quite a lot. Instead, I think a better strategy is to split this into a serie of smaller posts focused on the specific changes ;-)
So, in June I have organized a mini hackathon at my brand new place and invited some of the French Connection at home.</div></a><a class="article block px-3 py-4 hover:bg-slate-200 dark:hover:bg-slate-700" href=/posts/2014-11-24/what-the-fsck-did-just-happen/><h3 class="text-lg font-semibold mb-0.5">what the fsck did just happen</h3><div class="text-sm text-slate-500 dark:text-slate-400 line-clamp-2">Good news everyone !
With last post dating from almost a year, we can all agree that I&rsquo;ve outpassed my slacking skills by a great margin and I probably deserve an award of some kind ;-)
Anyways, there&rsquo;s been a few complaints during these 12 months because this blog was the main source of information for the OpenSMTPD project and several posts which used to describe features and configuration samples had suddenly disappeared.</div></a><a class="article block px-3 py-4 hover:bg-slate-200 dark:hover:bg-slate-700" href=/posts/2013-12-14/news-from-the-front/><h3 class="text-lg font-semibold mb-0.5">News-from-the-front</h3><div class="text-sm text-slate-500 dark:text-slate-400 line-clamp-2">EHLO readers,
This blog post is the first since a few months, I&rsquo;ve been busy and struggling with some personal health and familial issues. I won&rsquo;t share them here as its not really something anyone can help with, so&mldr; let&rsquo;s focus on OpenSMTPD !

As far as I&rsquo;m concerned, I&rsquo;ve been busy with other work but still a git log shows that between Eric and I we have accumulated quite a few things during this month. Below is a short non-exhaustive summary of changes and news.

I have not updated this blog since the release of OpenSMTPD 5.3, over a month ago. In the meantime, some minor bugs have been fixed and we have released OpenSMTPD 5.3.1.
The main reason for the silence is that I was busy with completely unrelated day-time work, unrelated opensource code, the OpenSMTPD book in progress and some minor health issues that have caused endless side-effects keeping my mind away from this blog.</div></a><a class="article block px-3 py-4 hover:bg-slate-200 dark:hover:bg-slate-700" href=/posts/2013-03-17/opensmtpd-5.3-released/><h3 class="text-lg font-semibold mb-0.5">OpenSMTPD 5.3 released</h3><div class="text-sm text-slate-500 dark:text-slate-400 line-clamp-2">OHAI !

We had planned to slow down a bit to prepare for release: no more feature, no more invasive changes until we tag something out of which we can publish a release. I then discussed with Bret Lambert (blambert@) and he asked me if we used some kind of code scanner to detect defects in our code.
We do use the clang static analyzer every now and then, the last time being a couple week ago, and we spend a few minutes cleaning up the defects we believe to be real issues.</div></a><a class="article block px-3 py-4 hover:bg-slate-200 dark:hover:bg-slate-700" href=/posts/2013-01-25/opensmtpd-gentlemen-fasten-your-seatbelt/><h3 class="text-lg font-semibold mb-0.5">OpenSMTPD: gentlemen, fasten your seatbelt</h3><div class="text-sm text-slate-500 dark:text-slate-400 line-clamp-2">OHAI,
Lately we have stabilized and decided that we&rsquo;re okay with the features we have for our first release, this time for good, so we focused on making sure that we didn&rsquo;t introduce regressions and that we were rock solid.
We stressed incoming and outgoing path and found areas of improvements. This will be a long-standing task, but we have already improved memory usage considerably under high-load, we&rsquo;re pretty happy with the result.</div></a><a class="article block px-3 py-4 hover:bg-slate-200 dark:hover:bg-slate-700" href=/posts/2013-01-18/opensmtpd-stress-and-features/><h3 class="text-lg font-semibold mb-0.5">OpenSMTPD: stress and features</h3><div class="text-sm text-slate-500 dark:text-slate-400 line-clamp-2">&lt;p>Hey,&lt;/p> I wanted to publish something last Friday but I unfortunately got my hands on a copy of Super Nintendo's Zelda which led to an instant loss of motivation.
Here's a quick summary of what happened recently in OpenSMTPD-land, it's not an exhaustive description and to be honest I'm keeping a lot of information private at this point and probably until release ;-)
A snapshot should be published tomorrow.
Stressing the daemon</div></a><a class="article block px-3 py-4 hover:bg-slate-200 dark:hover:bg-slate-700" href=/posts/2013-01-08/welcome-to-you-2013/><h3 class="text-lg font-semibold mb-0.5">Welcome to you, 2013</h3><div class="text-sm text-slate-500 dark:text-slate-400 line-clamp-2">YO!
I know I should have posted a &ldquo;Happy New Year&rdquo; note earlier but you know how it is: new year eve&rsquo;s aftermath, days to recover, work resumes, mood slacks, bleh.
Anyway, today&rsquo;s note is simply about that: wishing you and me an awesome year 2013 and hoping you will not turn it into a fucking mess. After all, you&rsquo;re in charge so we know who to blame ;-)
As far as I&rsquo;m concerned, year 2012 wasn&rsquo;t &ldquo;great&rdquo;, it was not the absolute suck either, it was even quite decent.</div></a><a class="article block px-3 py-4 hover:bg-slate-200 dark:hover:bg-slate-700" href=/posts/2012-12-28/opensmtpd-ssl-relay-stuff/><h3 class="text-lg font-semibold mb-0.5">OpenSMTPD: SSL & relay stuff</h3><div class="text-sm text-slate-500 dark:text-slate-400 line-clamp-2">OHAI,
I was unable to write a story last week as my desk broke into pieces for no apparent reason but my foot hitting it accidentally.
I still don&rsquo;t have a desk so I will make this short by not telling about the queue profiling and SQL log conversion I wrote, and not even writing about the filter work done by Eric, he&rsquo;ll write about it if he wants to or I&rsquo;ll do that next time.</div></a><a class="article block px-3 py-4 hover:bg-slate-200 dark:hover:bg-slate-700" href=/posts/2012-12-14/opensmtpd-ldap-support-selectable-source-dkim-and-goodies/><h3 class="text-lg font-semibold mb-0.5">OpenSMTPD: LDAP support, selectable source, DKIM and Goodies</h3><div class="text-sm text-slate-500 dark:text-slate-400 line-clamp-2">&lt;p>OHAI,&lt;/p> This week has been crazy, my brain melted a little as I worked on filters, it melted a little as I worked on LDAP and it melted a little more as I tried to trick Eric into working on filters with me (yes, that actually worked :-).
Anyway, as usual, this is just going to be a summary of what we did as tons of little stuff have been committed here and there.</div></a><a class="article block px-3 py-4 hover:bg-slate-200 dark:hover:bg-slate-700" href=/posts/2012-12-07/opensmtpd-fully-virtual-setups-updated-dns-mta-code-sqlite-support/><h3 class="text-lg font-semibold mb-0.5">OpenSMTPD: fully virtual setups, updated DNS & MTA code, SQLite support</h3><div class="text-sm text-slate-500 dark:text-slate-400 line-clamp-2">OHAI,
This week I had intended to work on filters. After 3 days of pain and swearing, even though it did move forward, I finally decided to step back for a few days and work on something else to preserve my sanity.
As you may have guessed, this week has not been too productive&mldr; Oh wait, yes it has ! It&rsquo;s actually been incredibly productive :-)
Just as usual, I will only write a summary for this week, the complete changelog can be retrieved from our mirror on Github.</div></a><a class="article block px-3 py-4 hover:bg-slate-200 dark:hover:bg-slate-700" href=/posts/2012-11-30/opensmtpd-more-features-more-cleanup-more-more/><h3 class="text-lg font-semibold mb-0.5">OpenSMTPD: more features, more cleanup, more more</h3><div class="text-sm text-slate-500 dark:text-slate-400 line-clamp-2">OHAI,
First of all, on a completely unrelated note, I&rsquo;d like to emphasize that this blog post is being written from my text editor launched by a little shell and pushed to poolp using the Ocean API. I can be web2.0 from console and emacs, and that&rsquo;s definitely worth a mention ;-)
As has become a habit, a lot of work has been poured in OpenSMTPD this week, here is an incomplete summary of the most notable changes.</div></a><a class="article block px-3 py-4 hover:bg-slate-200 dark:hover:bg-slate-700" href=/posts/2012-11-17/news-from-the-front/><h3 class="text-lg font-semibold mb-0.5">News from the front</h3><div class="text-sm text-slate-500 dark:text-slate-400 line-clamp-2">Almost a month since my last post&mldr; I know, I know.
So I left my position at Scality two weeks ago. I had been there for a year and a half working on a very interesting and tricky project. I will miss my colleagues and the discussions we had on all kinds of topic, I hope them the best future and that we will be able to share beers again ;-)</div></a><a class="article block px-3 py-4 hover:bg-slate-200 dark:hover:bg-slate-700" href=/posts/2012-08-31/opensmtpd-crypto/compress-fixes-and-import-initial-stab-at-ldap/><h3 class="text-lg font-semibold mb-0.5">OpenSMTPD: crypto/compress fixes and import initial stab at LDAP</h3><div class="text-sm text-slate-500 dark:text-slate-400 line-clamp-2">The crypto backend that has been committed a couple days ago started a little discussion and it was decided to switch the default cipher from Blowfish to AES-128 and make it a default.
Encryption can now be enabled as simply as:
queue encryption key &ldquo;foobar&rdquo;
That being said, Charles cleaned up a bit the compression code to make it use FILE* instead of file descriptors. This allows us to ensure we don&rsquo;t have to deal with any buffering and interruption handling code.</div></a><a class="article block px-3 py-4 hover:bg-slate-200 dark:hover:bg-slate-700" href=/posts/2012-08-29/opensmtpd-crypto_backend-and-encrypted-queue/><h3 class="text-lg font-semibold mb-0.5">OpenSMTPD: crypto_backend and encrypted queue</h3><div class="text-sm text-slate-500 dark:text-slate-400 line-clamp-2">A few days ago, Charles committed the compress_backend API which allowed transparent deflation/inflation of envelopes and messages as they hit the queue.
The compression code is executed before the queue_backend gets the data so that any queue_backend can benefit transparently from compression without having to add any code to handle it. Due to our design, this also means that if the queue_backend stores envelopes and messages remotely, then the compression will take place before sending and after fetching, the remote end only ever sees compressed data.</div></a><a class="article block px-3 py-4 hover:bg-slate-200 dark:hover:bg-slate-700" href=/posts/2012-08-26/opensmtpd-i-have-no-idea-for-that-title-sorry/><h3 class="text-lg font-semibold mb-0.5">OpenSMTPD: I have no idea for that title, sorry</h3><div class="text-sm text-slate-500 dark:text-slate-400 line-clamp-2">Howdie,
Eric and I had planned a loooooong time ago to have a hackathon this week-end. However, some asshole piece of shit ran into my car while it was parked, made it unable to take the road and flee without leaving a note. Long story made short, I had to be at the repair shop this week-end to be able to get my car before end of September.
We did get our hackathon though and while it was probably much less productive than if we had met in the same room, it was still very very interesting with tons of improvements and many great features written :-p</div></a><a class="article block px-3 py-4 hover:bg-slate-200 dark:hover:bg-slate-700" href=/posts/2012-08-21/opensmtpd-plenty-of-news/><h3 class="text-lg font-semibold mb-0.5">OpenSMTPD: plenty of news</h3><div class="text-sm text-slate-500 dark:text-slate-400 line-clamp-2">It&rsquo;s been over a month since my last post but I have an excuse: I was super busy, then I was super on vacation &mldr; but I&rsquo;m back again ;-)
So my life was pretty intense these last few weeks, both professionnally and on the opensource front. I&rsquo;ll explain later, for now let&rsquo;s just focus on the OpenSMTPD goodies.
OpenSMTPD portable to a new system First of all, I&rsquo;d like to stress out that Rune Lynge and Charles Longeau did an amazing job at porting OpenSMTPD to yet another system &mldr; MacOSX.</div></a><a class="article block px-3 py-4 hover:bg-slate-200 dark:hover:bg-slate-700" href=/posts/2012-07-15/g2k12-openbsd-hackathon-part-ii/><h3 class="text-lg font-semibold mb-0.5">g2k12: OpenBSD hackathon - part II</h3><div class="text-sm text-slate-500 dark:text-slate-400 line-clamp-2">Yesterday, I came back from Budapest and was too tired to write anything, but here&rsquo;s a quick summary of all the features that have been implemented with regard to OpenSMTPD by Eric, Charles and I.
First of all, Eric [eric@] has moved ASR, his asynchronous resolver, to OpenBSD&rsquo;s libc. This is a huge step forward that will allow OpenSMTPD to contain less code, while providing a better coverage of the resolver code.</div></a><a class="article block px-3 py-4 hover:bg-slate-200 dark:hover:bg-slate-700" href=/posts/2012-07-09/g2k12-openbsd-hackathon/><h3 class="text-lg font-semibold mb-0.5">g2k12: OpenBSD hackathon</h3><div class="text-sm text-slate-500 dark:text-slate-400 line-clamp-2">Yesterday, after nearly missing my plane by 5 minutes, I finally managed to make it to Budapest for g2k12, the OpenBSD general hackathon.
While this is not my first hackathon, this is the first general one with many hackers working on all kinds of subsystems ranging from ports to network and kernel. It&rsquo;s fun to see many people focused on improving different areas which you use daily, sometimes without even noticing, and doing it with as much fun as you are having fixing your own area ;-)</div></a><a class="article block px-3 py-4 hover:bg-slate-200 dark:hover:bg-slate-700" href=/posts/2012-06-19/opensmtpd-development-bug-tracker-github/><h3 class="text-lg font-semibold mb-0.5">OpenSMTPD: development, bug tracker & GitHub</h3><div class="text-sm text-slate-500 dark:text-slate-400 line-clamp-2">It&rsquo;s been a while since my last post about OpenSMTPD.
I don&rsquo;t know what Eric and Charles have been up to, I was quite busy with my daytime job and couldn&rsquo;t really spend much time on the hobby ;-)
Anyways, one of the most requested feature of OpenSMTPD is to provide users with a mean to report bugs and let them contribute more easily. It&rsquo;s been requested two times this week, it&rsquo;s been requested countless times in the last few weeks and months, and as a matter of fact it&rsquo;s also been a nuisance for us as until now we&rsquo;ve kept track of bugs and feature requests in my mailbox.</div></a><a class="article block px-3 py-4 hover:bg-slate-200 dark:hover:bg-slate-700" href=/posts/2012-06-06/opensmtpd-rest-queue/><h3 class="text-lg font-semibold mb-0.5">OpenSMTPD REST queue</h3><div class="text-sm text-slate-500 dark:text-slate-400 line-clamp-2">This is the first post of a series to illustrate and describe a &ldquo;proof of concept&rdquo; code by Charles, Eric and I. I will describe the features as they are implemented.
Since mid-November 2011, OpenSMTPD offers support for an extensible queue API. The queue_backend API allows a developer to write a custom storage driver by implementing a small set of functions that take care of storing, updating and removing envelopes and messages.</div></a><a class="article block px-3 py-4 hover:bg-slate-200 dark:hover:bg-slate-700" href=/posts/2012-05-17/opensmtpd-src-address-maps-and-spamhaus/><h3 class="text-lg font-semibold mb-0.5">OpenSMTPD: src-address maps and spamhaus</h3><div class="text-sm text-slate-500 dark:text-slate-400 line-clamp-2">First of all, I&rsquo;d like to &ldquo;thank&rdquo; The Spamhaus project which forced me into hacking this feature in a hurry.
See, I rent a server at online.net which I use for OpenSMTPD live testing and to run some experimental code before it hits the OpenBSD tree.
Yesterday I received a mail from a user complaining that he couldn&rsquo;t send mail to a friend because we were listed on spamhaus. That was very strange because ALL users at poolp.</div></a><a class="article block px-3 py-4 hover:bg-slate-200 dark:hover:bg-slate-700" href=/posts/2012-05-14/opensmtpd-relay-maps-new-url-syntax/><h3 class="text-lg font-semibold mb-0.5">OpenSMTPD relay maps & new url syntax</h3><div class="text-sm text-slate-500 dark:text-slate-400 line-clamp-2">When we first started working on OpenSMTPD, we planned for future features but we did not necessarily start integrating them right away as the goal was to bootstrap the project first with basic features.
Amongst these features was the ability to use mappings for outgoing MX servers. Currently, OpenSMTPD knows two ways of going out:
Using the DNS system to find MX records: accept for [&mldr;] relay
Using the provided mail exchanger: accept for [&mldr;] relay via &ldquo;my-mx.</div></a><a class="article block px-3 py-4 hover:bg-slate-200 dark:hover:bg-slate-700" href=/posts/2012-05-13/opensmtpd-map_compare-and-k_netaddr/><h3 class="text-lg font-semibold mb-0.5">OpenSMTPD, map_compare() and K_NETADDR</h3><div class="text-sm text-slate-500 dark:text-slate-400 line-clamp-2">Ok, I already posted about the new SQLite map_backend earlier today but it turns out that I&rsquo;ve been very productive, and it was worth another post ;-)
So I decided to start improving our maps support and make them usable from places where they weren&rsquo;t.
primary domains
OpenSMTPD supports two kinds of domains: primary domains and virtual domains. The primary domains do not require providing a list of recipients as it will use system accounts; whereas virtual domains require a list of recipients and/or a fallback address to be provided within a map.</div></a><a class="article block px-3 py-4 hover:bg-slate-200 dark:hover:bg-slate-700" href=/posts/2012-05-12/opensmtpd-meets-sqlite/><h3 class="text-lg font-semibold mb-0.5">OpenSMTPD meets SQLite</h3><div class="text-sm text-slate-500 dark:text-slate-400 line-clamp-2">During the r2k12 hackathon in Paris, Marc Espie committed SQLite to OpenBSD&rsquo;s base system.
This has the side effect that OpenSMTPD can start using it and while we agreed that we did not want it as a strong dependency, the various backends API allow us to make it a soft dependency that can be removed without breaking the daemon if someone really does not want SQLite linked.
Today I decided to give it a try and implement a SQLite backend to the map API.</div></a><a class="article block px-3 py-4 hover:bg-slate-200 dark:hover:bg-slate-700" href=/posts/2012-05-09/some-opensmtpd-news/><h3 class="text-lg font-semibold mb-0.5">Some OpenSMTPD news</h3><div class="text-sm text-slate-500 dark:text-slate-400 line-clamp-2">It&rsquo;s been a whiiiiiiile since my last OpenSMTPD related post. Time to break the slacking, blog-wise.
Unlike what would appear from the outside, there&rsquo;s been a lot of activity, discussions and planning, I&rsquo;ll address some here and will discuss it further soon.
First of all, chl@ has committed to a private branch a major improvement to the filter API: async DNS lookups. Due to the design of OpenSMTPD, it is not acceptable for a filter to perform a blocking call as it will prevent it from processing other sessions.</div></a><a class="article block px-3 py-4 hover:bg-slate-200 dark:hover:bg-slate-700" href=/posts/2005-05-21/fatigue-et-envie-de-vacances.../><h3 class="text-lg font-semibold mb-0.5">fatigue et envie de vacances...</h3><div class="text-sm text-slate-500 dark:text-slate-400 line-clamp-2">Je sais pas pourquoi, mais je suis epuise alors que j&rsquo;ai dormi pres de 14h cette nuit.

<a href=#>Gilles Chehade</a></p><center><img class="featured-image img-fluid" src=https://poolp.org/posts/2020-01-30/opensmtpd-advisory-dissected/cover.png alt="thumbnail for this post"></center><pre><code>TL;DR:
- Qualys released an advisory for a bad, bad vulnerability
- an MTA is a very bad software to have a vulnerability in
- hole was plugged but that's not enough, similar bugs should be mitigated in the future
- article discusses what could have prevented escalation despite the bug
</code></pre><h2 id=what-happened->What happened ?</h2><p>Qualys contacted by e-mail to tell me they found a vulnerability in OpenSMTPD and would send me the encrypted draft for advisory.</p><p>Receiving this kind of e-mail when working on a daemon that <strong>can&rsquo;t revoke completely privileges</strong> is not a thing you want to read,
particularly when you know how efficient they are at spotting a small bug and leveraging into a full-fledged clusterfuck.</p><p>While I was waiting for them to mail me back the draft,
I immediately jumped to the privileged process which is what worries me the most,
and started reading all the entry points to that process at runtime.</p><p>This isn&rsquo;t a big task,
the privileged process doesn&rsquo;t do many operations at runtime:</p><ul><li>it opens <code>~/.forward</code> files located in home directories</li><li>it authenticates username/password pair against <code>bsd_auth(3)</code></li><li>it creates user-owned mda processes for mail delivery agents</li></ul><p>In the case of <code>~/.forward</code> files,
it checks if the user has a <code>~/.forward</code> file with correct permissions and mode,
opens it then passes the file descriptor back to an unprivileged process without doing anything with it.
I didn&rsquo;t see a way this could be exploited.</p><p>In the case of authentication,
which was my main worry given the <a href=https://www.qualys.com/2019/12/04/cve-2019-19521/authentication-vulnerabilities-openbsd.txt target=_blank rel=noopener>recent vulnerabilities they found in the &lt;code>bsd_auth(3)&lt;/code> layer</a>,
it received a username and password and passed them directly to <code>auth_userokay(3)</code>,
returning the result to unprivileged process.
I was highly suspicious of a bug here but given how simple the code is,
I didn&rsquo;t see a way this could be exploited either.</p><p>Finally,
the user-owned mda processes creation became my main worry.
It doesn&rsquo;t do much as it basically calls <code>fork()</code> and executes the mda command <strong>using recipient user privileges</strong>,
but it also has a special case for <code>mbox</code> which <strong>can&rsquo;t work without privileges</strong>.</p><p>I had hope that the bug they found would be elsewhere and not so bad as the privileged process is fairly isolated.
It can only be reached by going through another unprivileged process and its input validation.
The <strong>worst-case scenario</strong> would be finding an exploitable bug either in the <code>mbox</code> delivery special case,
or in the small portion of code before privileges dropping for other mail delivery agents.
I focused efforts on reading the code path again and again but didn&rsquo;t find a bug.
I gave up after a few hours and decided to wait for the draft.</p><p>I woke up to an advisory draft <strong>exploiting the worst-case scenario</strong>&mldr;
through a <strong>logic bug in the input validation code of an unprivileged process</strong>.</p><p>Perfect, just perfect.</p><center><img src=/images/2020-01-29-mma.jpg></center><h2 id=the-problem>The problem</h2><p>OpenSMTPD uses an input validation function,
<code>smtp_mailaddr()</code>,
to ensure that e-mail addresses that enter the queue are valid.</p><p>What the function does is that it checks that the e-mail address parses into a <code>struct mailaddr</code>,
then validates the local part with <code>valid_localpart()</code> and the domain part with <code>valid_domainpart()</code>.
The <code>valid_localpart()</code> function checks that the local part only contains characters from an allowed set.
The <code>valid_domainpart()</code> either checks that the domain is a valid IP address using <code>inet_pton()</code>,
or that it is a valid hostname using <code>res_hnok()</code>.</p><p>The <code>smtp_mailaddr()</code> function also has to handle <strong>two cases</strong> where an invalid address is still acceptable and has to go through:</p><p><strong>The first one</strong> is that of bounces (MAILER-DAEMON) with empty local and domain parts,
<code>MAIL FROM:&lt;></code>,
which is only acceptable during the MAIL FROM phase of SMTP.</p><p><strong>The second one</strong> is that of addresses with empty domains,
<code>MAIL FROM:&lt;gilles></code>,
which is generated by some MUA when used locally and which will use the local domain attached to the listener,
<code>MAIL FROM:&lt;gilles@laptop.poolp.org></code> on my machine.
This was initially not accepted by the daemon but had to be implemented for interoperability,
which is when the bug was introduced.</p><p>Unfortunately for us,
Qualys identified a <strong>logic error</strong> in <code>smtp_mailaddr()</code>.
If one of the checks on local or domain parts fails,
<code>smtp_mailaddr()</code> checks if it is due to one of the two cases above.
In the case of failed domain,
it mistakenly does an erroneous check that cancels out the previous call <code>valid_localpart()</code> and,
as a result,
an address that was rejected due to an invalid local part gets accepted again if there is no domain.</p><pre tabindex=0><code>MAIL FROM:&lt;gilles;test@laptop.poolp.org&gt;

</span></span></code></pre></div><p>Back then,
the mistake had no consequences as OpenSMTPD had a very different implementation for delivery.
It didn&rsquo;t handle MDA through external utilities,
like is done in other MTA,
but used builtin implementations for all methods (<code>maildir</code>, <code>lmtp</code>, <code>file</code>, <code>mda</code>, &mldr;).
The <code>mbox</code> delivery was handled as a special case through a simple <code>execle()</code>.</p><p>With this way of dealing with MDA,
there was no shell involved and the incorrectly validated e-mail address wasn&rsquo;t in the path of delivery,
the bug had no consequences despite being there.
<strong>This way of dealing with MDA wasn&rsquo;t right though</strong>.
It came with its share of complexity and short-comings,
most notably a very complex mda layer handling all methods differently with many special cases,
and a more complex <code>forkmda()</code> function which is code running in the privileged process and that we want as simple as possible.</p><p>The bug became exploitable with another unrelated commit <strong>three years and a half later</strong>,
in a different area,
when OpenSMTPD switched to the new grammar and brought support for MDA through external utilities,
ditching its builtin delivery methods.</p><p>Basically,
instead of each delivery method coming with its own structure and custom checks in the entire code path,
they were reimplemented as standalone executables that could be used by any MTA.
From this point,
OpenSMTPD didn&rsquo;t know the difference between <code>maildir</code> and <code>lmtp</code>,
they were just regular mail delivery agents.
The MDA execution code path got simplified by removing all delivery-specific cases and unified so it would craft a command line,
<strong>using what we assumed to be correctly validated input</strong>,
that could be executed after the <code>forkmda()</code>function dropped its privileges.</p><p>Because the delivery agents are standalone executables that expect their options on the command line with quoting and escaping support,
we decided to use the shell to execute the command rather than rewriting our own command-line parser that might contain parsing bugs.
<strong>This is something done in other MTA, we didn&rsquo;t invent a clever way to be lazy</strong>.
The shell is executed with the recipient privileges and passed the mda command,
similarly to if the recipient had executed the command themselves in their own shell.
Since the command is either crafted from <code>smtpd.conf</code> which is controlled by postmaster,
or <code>.forward</code> which is controlled by the recipient,
there is supposedly no problem <strong>as long as the input is properly validated</strong>.</p><p>We could jump to the conclusion that using <code>system()</code> instead of <code>execle()</code> is what allowed the escalation but this is inaccurate.
Incorrectly validated input and <code>system()</code> made the <strong>exploit</strong> possible,
<strong>not the escalation</strong>.
All delivery methods use the <strong>exact same code path</strong> and they are not all subject to the escalation.
For instance,
<code>lmtp</code> allowed <strong>unprivileged</strong> execution of commands whereas <code>maildir</code> is <strong>unimpacted</strong>.</p><p>What made the escalation possible is a special case that OpenSMTPD has to handle <strong>specifically</strong> for <code>mbox</code>,
and which opens the door to escalation if a bug manages to be exploited in that (relatively small) code path.</p><h2 id=the-fix>The fix</h2><p>When I received the advisory draft,
I hurried to produce a fix as soon as possible then ended with two diffs that I showed Qualys:
a quick fix that just plugged the hole,
and a better fix that plugged the hole by rewriting the <code>smtp_mailaddr()</code> function differently.</p><p>The quick fix is straightforward and can be implemented as a one-liner,
it just tested <code>valid_localpart()</code> again when handling the missing domain case:</p><div class=highlight><pre tabindex=0 style=color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#282a36;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4><code class=language-diff data-lang=diff><span style=display:flex><span><span style=color:#f55>--- src/usr.sbin/smtpd/smtp_session.c	2019/10/04 08:34:29	1.415

</span></span></code></pre></div><p>There is room for improvement and I think this function should be rewritten in a different style to make it harder to introduce bugs.
But this version works,
it was tested,
proof-read by multiple people (including the auditors),
and since it is unlikely to change before a long time (last change was in 2014),
I will tackle it with a clear mind, not right now while still stressed.</p><p>Fixing the bug like I did plugs the hole,
but that&rsquo;s not enough for me to be relaxed,
it closes the door to the escalation but doesn&rsquo;t <strong>build a wall of concrete in front of it</strong>.
Today, there&rsquo;s no known bug that affects this code path and we may be fine,
but unless we actually kill the <strong>potential</strong> for escalation,
we&rsquo;ll never be sure that researches won&rsquo;t find another bug and another creative way to exploit it.</p><p>In this article,
I&rsquo;ll discuss mitigation mechanisms that I think should be put in place to avoid this from happening again,
regardless of what bugs are found in processes exposed to attackers.
Their goal is to deal with the <strong>potential</strong> for escalation, not with specific bugs.</p><h2 id=my-post-mortem-thoughts>My post-mortem thoughts</h2><p>Even though fixing <code>smtp_mailaddr()</code> plugs the hole,
<strong>a bug in the smtp layer should not have been able to result in such a catastrophic outcome</strong>,
<strong>regardless of the bug</strong>.
Today, with the combination of <code>pledge()</code>,
privileges separation (smtp engine runs as unprivileged user <code>_smtpd</code>),
filesystem isolation (smtp engine is <code>chroot()</code>-ed to <code>/var/empty</code>),
and several internal consistency checks that will <code>fatal()</code> if something fishy is detected,
misbehaving code is constrained and we expect limited consequences.
My take has always been that I can&rsquo;t code bug-free so I <strong>expect that bugs will be found</strong>,
and I want OpenSMTPD to <strong>crash</strong> in such cases so that I can fix the bug and roll a release.
A crash in SMTP land is really not a big deal,
protocol is fault-tolerant and other mail exchangers have retry logic,
I can live with that.</p><p>The incident here was <strong>not caused by misbehaving code</strong>,
it was caused by a <strong>logic error</strong> and <strong>the code did what it was written to do</strong>:
it didn&rsquo;t corrupt memory and dodged sanitisation to craft an IPC message all the way to an exploit in another process.
This is not a problem caused by the language,
likes some people imply,
and not a problem caused by a memory corruption of some sort.
The sanitisation function <strong>incorrectly validated the input</strong> and from that point,
<strong>the input followed the exact same code path as any other valid input</strong> until it reached the mda layer.
<strong>This is not a failure of the mechanisms put in place to mitigate misbehaving code</strong>,
and I think it is important to consider it for what it is:
a correct implementation of an incorrect logic.</p><p>Seeing it as such isn&rsquo;t a way to shrug it off,
quite the opposite.
If we consider the incident without the human factor and try to address this with misbehaving code detection,
it is bound to fail because&mldr; <strong>the code did exactly what it was written to do</strong>.
We may slap a few sanity checks here and there but if they&rsquo;re supposed to check the same thing,
they will have the same mistake.
We can&rsquo;t fix my stupid with checks.</p><p>We can&rsquo;t prevent human mistakes,
they will happen because tools won&rsquo;t help spot that a human-described logic is flawed.
What we need is to make changes so that <strong>OpenSMTPD becomes more resistant to human errors</strong>.
In other words,
we need safe-guards that are not dependant on sanity checks and input,
we need safe-guards that will guarantee that <strong>even</strong> if OpenSMTPD lets completely untrusted input pass through,
this will have the most limited consequences&mldr;
<strong>then</strong> we ensure that it doesn&rsquo;t let untrusted input pass through.</p><p>What made the exploit possible is the logic mistake in validation code and the use of <code>system()</code> with that invalid input,
but what made the <strong>escalation</strong> possible is the <code>mbox</code> delivery method.</p><h2 id=the-problems-with-mbox-delivery>The problem(s) with <code>mbox</code> delivery</h2><p>When a delivery takes places,
OpenSMTPD does the delivery on behalf of a recipient user.
Regardless of the delivery method,
it will create a new mda process that will handle the delivery and drop its privileges to that of the recipient user.
This is meant to ensure that a user adding a dangerous command in their <code>.forward</code> files can only impact themselves.</p><p>Furthermore,
OpenSMTPD strictly <strong>forbids</strong> execution of an mda command with a privileged account:
<strong>root is not allowed to receive mail with <code>maildir</code> or <code>lmtp</code></strong>,
the delivery will be aborted with an error message that <strong>delivery to root is forbidden without an alias to an unprivileged user</strong>.
The mda command is not processed.
This is what saves <code>maildir</code> and <code>lmtp</code> from being subjected to the escalation:
<strong>they cannot be ran from a privileged process</strong>,
bugs will <strong>at most</strong> impact the recipient user which <strong>can never be root</strong>.
Not that it&rsquo;s good, but it&rsquo;s an order of magnitude less bad.</p><p>In the case of <code>mbox</code> however we can&rsquo;t do that.</p><p>First of all,
if we take a fresh install,
we can&rsquo;t assume that an unprivileged user exists since a user might not have created one at install.
In this situation,
if <code>mbox</code> refuses delivery to root then mails regarding <code>security</code> or <code>daily/weekly/monthly</code> will not be deliverable.
Forbidding delivery to root implies requiring the creation of a user that root can be aliased to.
For this reason,
we can&rsquo;t easily switch from <code>mbox</code> to another delivery method either since they would enforce the restriction,
breaking mail out of the box.</p><p>Then,
unlike <code>maildir</code> which writes to a subdirectory of the recipient user and can therefore do it with the recipient user privileges,
<code>mbox</code> writes to a common directory,
usually <code>/var/mail</code> or <code>/var/spool/mail</code>.
The mailbox is user-owned,
so that <code>/var/mail/gilles</code> can be written or read by <code>gilles</code>,
but since <code>gilles</code> cannot be allowed to create his own mailbox in the common directory,
the creation has to be done by a privileged process that can both create the mailbox AND change its ownership.</p><p>Since the <code>mbox</code> format doesn&rsquo;t support concurrent deliveries,
it also requires some locking to avoid concurrent writes.
This locking is historically done by creating a <code>gilles.lock</code> file in the common directory.
Mail user agents expect this.
This whole delivery logic is handled outside of the daemon by <code>mail.local</code>,
a delivery agent that preexists OpenSMTPD and which we inherited from the previous era.
The downside is that <code>mail.local</code> <strong>requires being called with privileges</strong> to do the work and handle privileges dropping itself.</p><p><strong>This is where the potential for escalation resides.</strong></p><p>When <code>mbox</code> delivery is set,
OpenSMTPD <strong>HAS</strong> to create a privileged process to execute <code>mail.local</code> no matter what user will receive the mail.
It therefore has an explicit special case that forking a privileged mda is forbidden&mldr; <strong>except</strong> for <code>mbox</code>.
Even if root had a <code>~/.forward</code> explicitely calling <code>mail.local</code>, it would be be forbidden.</p><p>The code path is relatively small:
the mda process is created with privileges,
<code>mail.local</code> is executed and will <strong>internally lower its privileges</strong>.
Unfortunately for us,
the exploit basically managed to replace the execution of <code>mail.local</code> with the execution of an arbitrary command,
sitting in between the privileged process being <code>fork()</code>-ed and <code>mail.local</code> dropping privileges.</p><p>The <strong>source of the problem</strong> is that unlike other delivery methods,
when using the <code>mbox</code> delivery method OpenSMTPD is <strong>required</strong> to create this privileged process.
In this case the exploit <strong>targeted</strong> the way we executed the mail delivery agent but,
thinking further,
if an exploit was found that managed to abuse anything between the <code>fork()</code> and the execution of <code>mail.local</code>,
we <strong>could</strong> be in a similar situation using a different attack vector:
during a small period of time,
we have a <strong>privileged process</strong> with a <strong>potential</strong> for being exploited somehow.</p><p>This is why I believe plugging the hole is <strong>not enough</strong>.
It solves the <strong>immediate problem</strong> but not the <strong>underlying issue</strong>,
it doesn&rsquo;t kill the <strong>potential</strong> for escalation:
<strong>if root is allowed to receive mail in a root-owned mailbox</strong> then at some point a privileged process had to do the delivery.</p><p>The <strong>only</strong> way to kill this potential for escalation is to get rid of the privileged mda process.
No special case, no nothing.
If we don&rsquo;t have a privileged mda process,
then a bug may exist and an exploit may find its way into the process,
but it won&rsquo;t allow escalation.</p><p>This is where we must be heading towards and it&rsquo;ll require some creative solutions to work around <code>mbox</code> limitations.</p><h2 id=several-ideas>Several ideas</h2><p>Since this blew up to my face,
I had several ideas to tackle this.
Some were already discussed and not retained because they had potential for other issues.
The current ideas are these:</p><ul><li>switching back mail delivery agents to <code>execle()</code></li><li>disallowing delivery to root</li><li>managing to somehow run <code>mail.local</code> without privileges</li><li>mbox creation and locking in OpenSMTPD to allow user execution of <code>mail.local</code></li></ul><p>Not each of them is straight-forward but each of them would have avoided the escalation,
regardless of the bug being present,
so I think these are critical to implement in order to avoid future bugs from having the kind of impact we experienced.</p><h2 id=switching-back-mail-delivery-agents-to-execle>Switching back mail delivery agents to <code>execle()</code></h2><p>This doesn&rsquo;t solve the underlying issue of having a privileged process for <code>mbox</code>,
but it would have prevented this specific attack.</p><p>Moving <strong>all</strong> mail delivery agents to <code>execle()</code> is tricky but we&rsquo;re going to got that way.
I have already written a diff to switch <code>mbox</code> and it will be committed shortly.
The <code>maildir</code> and <code>lmtp</code> will be similarly converted.</p><p>The only issue with that move is that some mail delivery agents expect a command-line interface that&rsquo;s more complex than ours:</p><div class=highlight><pre tabindex=0 style=color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#282a36;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4><code class=language-cfg data-lang=cfg><span style=display:flex><span><span style=color:#50fa7b>action foobar mda &#34;/usr/local/bin/procmail -a -ton -of -options \&#34;with quotes and escaping\&#34;&#34;</span>
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>or it&rsquo;s <code>~/.forward</code> variant:</p><div class=highlight><pre tabindex=0 style=color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#282a36;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4><code class=language-cfg data-lang=cfg><span style=display:flex><span><span style=color:#50fa7b>|/usr/local/bin/procmail -a -ton -of -options &#34;with quotes and \&#34;escaping\&#34;&#34;</span>
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>or even it&rsquo;s <code>/etc/mail/aliases</code> variant:</p><div class=highlight><pre tabindex=0 style=color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#282a36;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4><code class=language-cfg data-lang=cfg><span style=display:flex><span><span style=color:#50fa7b>lists:		|/usr/local/bin/mailing-list.py -a -ton -of -options</span>
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>I doubt anyone wants to see these go away,
and switching them to <code>execle()</code> implies reimplementing a command-line parser with shell-like semantics,
then using the parsed command line to call the <code>execle()</code> function.
This is the literal definition of rewriting a shell and I&rsquo;d rather rely on a standard shell than rewriting my dumbed-down one.</p><p>Since these commands can <strong>never run with privileges</strong>,
what I suggest is that we use a wrapping mail delivery agent with a simple interface that we can easily plug through <code>execle()</code>,
then let THAT mail delivery agent run the mda command through a shell.
This allows us to have a single code path through <code>execle()</code> for all mail delivery agents in the daemon,
and restrict the <code>system()</code> call to specific use-cases handled by a specific mail delivery agent outside the daemon.</p><h2 id=disallowing-delivery-to-root>Disallowing delivery to root</h2><p>No need for much explanations here:
this would have effectively prevented the privileges escalation despite the logic bug.</p><p>I think we should <strong>disallow deliveries to privileged users unconditionally</strong>.
I never thought it was a good idea to accept doing it and this is why I disallowed it for everything but <code>mbox</code>.
This is going to be inconvenient to many because it means that root <strong>HAS</strong> to be an alias,
but everyone using <code>maildir</code> or <code>lmtp</code> has been in this mode for years now and I never had a complaint about it.
We can&rsquo;t tell people not to log in as root and use <code>doas</code> or <code>sudo</code>,
then ensure that everything is convenient for them to log in as root and have their mails delivered knowing the risks.
It doesn&rsquo;t make sense.</p><p>This will put us at odds with other MTA implementations that accept delivering mail to root,
and every time I suggested doing something differently from other MTA people got angry at me for not being able to keep their habits.
But now that this blew to my face I don&rsquo;t think there&rsquo;s an excuse for keeping a time-bomb that we know can blow hard.
I hope there will be no resistance to this change,
but at some point, if we refuse to diverge from dangerous practices it means we are knowingly leaving potential for escalation.
Someone else will have to defend why this is a good idea.</p><p>While at it&mldr;</p><p>On the somewhat related side-note of doing something I dislike because other MTA do it and we shouldn&rsquo;t diverge,
supporting commands in aliases is also a bad idea from a security point of view.
It doesn&rsquo;t come with the same level of risks,
but it also opens the potential for abuse and I&rsquo;ve been willing to get rid of that for years.
I don&rsquo;t know of ANY use-case of executing a command from aliases that can&rsquo;t be solved from a <code>~/.forward</code> file in a safer way.
It&rsquo;s less convenient and it requires a dedicated user, but it&rsquo;s safer.</p><div class=highlight><pre tabindex=0 style=color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#282a36;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4><code class=language-c data-lang=c><span style=display:flex><span>			<span style=color:#6272a4>/* this battle needs to be fought ... */</span>

however this is not sufficient if <code>mail.local</code> still requires privileges to deliver to <code>gilles</code>.
The problem is the requirement for privileges during delivery,
not the fact that a user itself is privileged.</p><p>I&rsquo;ve already explained the problem with <code>mail.local</code> and why it requires privileges.
We&rsquo;re discussing with other OpenBSD hackers the option to change permissions of <code>/var/mail</code>,
the option to use a <em>setgid</em> <code>mail.local</code> and we&rsquo;ll continue exploring similar options.</p><p>The idea for a group-writeable mail spool was apparently rejected in the past but it may be time to reassess.
I don&rsquo;t really have a good intuition about doing this,
I don&rsquo;t know why but I&rsquo;ve been wrong before so it&rsquo;s worth investigating this option with the help of other developers.</p><p>The bottom line is that <strong>unless <code>mail.local</code> can be started without privileges</strong>,
no effort to reduce the potential for escalation will succeed.
At the same time,
we need to keep in mind that <code>mail.local</code> is not an OpenSMTPD specific component,
and changing it must be done with care to avoid breaking other software.
If managing to use <code>mail.local</code> without privileges requires making changes to it,
we may have to implement an OpenSMTPD specific implementation.</p><h2 id=mbox-creation-and-locking-in-opensmtpd-to-allow-user-execution-of-maillocal>mbox creation and locking in OpenSMTPD to allow user execution of <code>mail.local</code></h2><p>Finally,
a proposal I discussed with other hackers was to have OpenSMTPD handle the mailbox creation and locking.</p><p>We already consider <code>mbox</code> as a special case and we could convert that special case from &ldquo;needs privileges&rdquo; to &ldquo;needs locking&rdquo;.
In this scenario,
when a delivery uses <code>mbox</code>,
the daemon can do the locking and mailbox creation <strong>itself</strong> before dropping privileges and executing <code>mail.local</code> unprivileged,
like any other mail delivery agent.
The lock would be removed upon <em>SIGCHLD</em> of the mail delivery agent.
This would effectively allow removing the reasons for which <code>mail.local</code> requires privileges.</p><p>As for <code>mail.local</code>,
all it would need to do is allow execution from unprivileged user by removing the <strong>explicit check for root</strong> it has today.
This would still allow to use it with other MTA that expect it to be privileged,
while allowing it to run unprivileged with OpenSMTPD.
As for locking,
no changes would be required since already supports skipping locking through the <code>-L</code> option.</p><p>Some people see this as doing part of the delivery in OpenSMTPD and part in <code>mail.local</code>.
I disagree and see this as executing a mail delivery agent in locking barriers:
the daemon sets a locked environement around mail delivery agent execution,
the mail delivery agent doesn&rsquo;t know or care about the locks.
This is word plays but seeing it this way makes more sense to me and doesn&rsquo;t sound hackish at all.</p><p>This coupled with preventing delivery to root would effectively remove the potential for escalation in <code>mbox</code>.</p><h2 id=closing-words>Closing words</h2><p>I don&rsquo;t know where to start,
this section will not be as structured as previous ones.</p><p>First of all,
I&rsquo;d like to <strong>thank the people at Qualys</strong>.
They found a critical bug that could have remained out of sight until exploited by less friendly people.
I won&rsquo;t say it is a pleasure to be on my side of the advisory but as unpleasant as it is,
<strong>it makes the software safer on the long run</strong>.
I hope they don&rsquo;t find something else,
and if they do I hope it&rsquo;s not something as big,
but it is a <strong>good thing for users</strong> to have such competent people studying the code,
as painful as it is for the developers when they find something.</p><p>Then,
people should use this as a reminder not to put <strong>too much</strong> trust in it.
An MTA is a piece of software that can&rsquo;t drop all privileges,
otherwise it would already be done,
and at the same time a software that is highly exposed to user-supplied data from untrusted sources.
Having an MTA, whichever it is, exposed to the wild and not running on its very own machine will always be a risk.
As careful as I can be,
I&rsquo;ll make errors and some of these errors will slip in.
The only thing I can promise is that I always handle them the way I handled this one,
not just fixing the issue but trying to kill the potential.</p><p>That being said,
I will continue discussing the ideas from this article and possibly others to start implementing them as soon as possible.
My goal is to kill the potential for escalation in <code>forkmda()</code> <strong>before the next major release</strong>.
I have a few weeks in front of me and there may be some very quick wins to do here that would remove the existing risks.</p><hr><p>Comments: <a href=https://github.com/poolpOrg/poolp.org/discussions/117 target=_blank rel=noopener>https://github.com/poolpOrg/poolp.org/discussions/117</a></p><script src=https://giscus.app/client.js data-repo=poolpOrg/poolp.org data-repo-id="MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMjYxODk2MjA=" data-category=Articles data-category-id=DIC_kwDOB4WANM4B-Zf1 data-mapping=og:title data-strict=0 data-reactions-enabled=1 data-emit-metadata=1 data-input-position=top data-theme=light data-lang=en data-loading=lazy crossorigin=anonymous async></script></article></div></div><script type=text/javascript src=/main.js defer></script></body></html>
