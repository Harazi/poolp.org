It&rsquo;s been requested two times this week, it&rsquo;s been requested countless times in the last few weeks and months, and as a matter of fact it&rsquo;s also been a nuisance for us as until now we&rsquo;ve kept track of bugs and feature requests in my mailbox. Bug reports have been lost, others have been forgotten, it&rsquo;s not productive.</p><p>I decided to take a shot at fixing that issue and proposed to my fellow coworkers that we create a Github project, just like what jasper@ did for ports. Charles was already a big fan of Github (&ldquo;I &lt;3 Github&rdquo;) and Eric approved and created an account. So here we are ;-)</p><p>Why Github ?</p><p>I initially thought about writing a small tool at poolp.org to keep track of bugs and features, and it wouldn&rsquo;t be too hard, but it requires time and that is a very scarce resource these days.</p><p>I&rsquo;ve had very good feedback of Github, it has a nice interface, is easy to use and has the bug tracker, comments and annotations I want. I don&rsquo;t see the point in reinventing the wheel (at this point) so as far as I&rsquo;m concerned it will be just fine.</p><p>We don&rsquo;t intend to use the repository there as a development repository but instead as a mean to let users know what&rsquo;s in the works by exposing upcoming features.</p><p>See, OpenSMTPD has several repositories:</p><p>The OpenBSD repository, which is our primary repository and where OpenBSD users should grab the latest version of OpenSMTPD. It is as close to production-ready as it can get and no other tree (that I know of :-) holds a &ldquo;better&rdquo; version.</p><p>The portable repository, which is maintained by Charles Longeau at Github, and which is basically a checkout of the OpenBSD tree with the portability goo required to build on other operating systems.</p><p>Then, at poolp.org, we have a private repository where Charles, Eric and I create branches to work on specific new features that can possibly break OpenSMTPD, bring their share of regressions, or that are simply not meant to hit the OpenBSD tree as-is (the so-called &ldquo;experiments&rdquo; :)</p><p>The repository at poolp.org contains at least 2 branches:</p><p>The master branch which is synchronized with the OpenBSD tree and from which we derive when we implement new features; the poolp branch which is an experimental branch we use to run code live and test that it is reliable before it is committed to OpenBSD; and eventually several minor branches that come and go.</p><p>The workflow goes more or less like this:</p><p>create a branch X from master for feature X;
work on feature X until reasonnably stable;
merge feature X in branch poolp;
test on mx1.poolp.org that branch poolp is stable;
commit feature on OpenBSD;
synchronize master branch with OpenBSD;
The repository at Github would clone our master branch and eventually other branches, making it visible to the community.</p></div><div class="row PageNavigation d-flex justify-content-between font-weight-bold"><a class="d-block col-md-6" href=https://poolp.org/posts/2012-07-09/g2k12-openbsd-hackathon/>&#171; g2k12: OpenBSD hackathon</a>
