This post won't need a TL;DR as I'll keep it short. Generalized anxiety disorder and alexithymia. Late 2018, I&rsquo;ve been diagnosed with generalized anxiety disorder and alexithymia a couple weeks apart.
The anxiety disorder didn&rsquo;t really come as a surprise as I know very well the traumatic experience that led to the disorder. It&rsquo;ll still take a lot of hours of hypnosis to continue cleaning up trauma after trauma, but taking care of it and releasing some of the traumas has improved considerably my anxiety.</div></a><a class="article block px-3 py-4 hover:bg-slate-200 dark:hover:bg-slate-700" href=/posts/2018-12-21/opensmtpd-now-supports-regex-in-match-rules/><h3 class="text-lg font-semibold mb-0.5">OpenSMTPD now supports regex in match rules</h3><div class="text-sm text-slate-500 dark:text-slate-400 line-clamp-2">TL;DR: regex table lookups were introduced for builtin filters. After a few weeks of working solely on filters, I wanted to work on something else. Using the same mechanism, all match criterias using tables can support regex. K_REGEX lookups The table mechanism is used within OpenSMTPD to perform all kinds of lookups.
Recently, while working on builtin filters, I introduced the K_REGEX lookup type allowing tables to serve regex(3) patterns.</div></a><a class="article block px-3 py-4 hover:bg-slate-200 dark:hover:bg-slate-700" href=/posts/2018-12-19/more-on-opensmtpd-filters/><h3 class="text-lg font-semibold mb-0.5">more on OpenSMTPD filters</h3><div class="text-sm text-slate-500 dark:text-slate-400 line-clamp-2">TL;DR: Not this time, pal/gal, I took hours writing this post, you'll take a few minutes reading it all. Oh, and merry X-mas :-* A bit of short-sighted history The filtering feature has been introduced only recently in OpenSMTPD, first presented on this blog a month ago.
I had a working proof-of-concept running on my laptop and my plan was to start bringing the code to the OpenBSD tree, small chunks by small chunks, through a serie of diffs.</div></a><a class="article block px-3 py-4 hover:bg-slate-200 dark:hover:bg-slate-700" href=/posts/2018-12-06/opensmtpd-proc-filters-fc-rdns/><h3 class="text-lg font-semibold mb-0.5">OpenSMTPD proc filters & fc-rDNS</h3><div class="text-sm text-slate-500 dark:text-slate-400 line-clamp-2">TL;DR: I *FINALFUCKINGLY* commited proc filters support allowing full filtering in OpenSMTPD. eric@ implemented fc-rDNS lookups. fc-rDNS fc-rDNS, or forward-confirmed reverse DNS, consists in performing a reverse DNS lookup to determine the hostname associated to an IP address&mldr; then performing a DNS lookup on that hostname to check if it resolves back to the IP address.
On my request, eric@ implemented fc-rDNS lookups in our SMTP engine, causing OpenSMTPD to perform the double lookup upon clients connections.</div></a><a class="article block px-3 py-4 hover:bg-slate-200 dark:hover:bg-slate-700" href=/posts/2018-11-09/opensmtpd-reporting-update/><h3 class="text-lg font-semibold mb-0.5">OpenSMTPD reporting update</h3><div class="text-sm text-slate-500 dark:text-slate-400 line-clamp-2">TL;DR: The reporting mechanism has been described shortly in my previous article about both reporting and filters. Let's focus a bit more on the reporting bits this time. The format is improving further and has extended to outgoing trafic reporting. Reporting In previous article, I described the events reporting mechanism that has been introduced in the development branch of OpenSMTPD.
To sum it up, you could now write an event processor as simple as a shell script reading its stdin on a loop:</div></a><a class="article block px-3 py-4 hover:bg-slate-200 dark:hover:bg-slate-700" href=/posts/2018-11-03/opensmtpd-released-and-upcoming-filters-preview/><h3 class="text-lg font-semibold mb-0.5">OpenSMTPD released and upcoming filters preview</h3><div class="text-sm text-slate-500 dark:text-slate-400 line-clamp-2">TL;DR: Filters have been a (the most ?) long awaited feature in OpenSMTPD.

OpenSMTPD 6.4.0 was released ! We have released OpenSMTPD 6.4.0 last week without filters.
I won&rsquo;t expand on the features in the 6.</div></a><a class="article block px-3 py-4 hover:bg-slate-200 dark:hover:bg-slate-700" href=/posts/2018-05-21/switching-to-opensmtpd-new-config/><h3 class="text-lg font-semibold mb-0.5">switching to OpenSMTPD new config</h3><div class="text-sm text-slate-500 dark:text-slate-400 line-clamp-2">TL;DR: Switching to new config is not too hard and can be done in minutes. The new config is also a new queue that is not backwards compatible. The easiest way is to flush the mail queue before switching. We came up with a solution to help maintainers of more complex setups. Switching from old config to new config The new OpenSMTPD configuration grammar is slightly different from the current one, rules are no longer stated as single lines, but the conversion from previous ruleset to new ruleset isn&rsquo;t that hard.</div></a><a class="article block px-3 py-4 hover:bg-slate-200 dark:hover:bg-slate-700" href=/posts/2018-04-30/opensmtpd-new-config/><h3 class="text-lg font-semibold mb-0.5">OpenSMTPD new config</h3><div class="text-sm text-slate-500 dark:text-slate-400 line-clamp-2">TL;DR: OpenBSD #p2k18 hackathon took place at Epitech in Nantes. I was organizing the hackathon but managed to make progress on OpenSMTPD. As mentionned at EuroBSDCon the one-line per rule config format was a design error. A new configuration grammar is almost ready and the underlying structures are simplified. Refactor removes ~750 lines of code and solves _many_ issues that were side-effects of the design error. New features are going to be unlocked thanks to this.</div></a><a class="article block px-3 py-4 hover:bg-slate-200 dark:hover:bg-slate-700" href=/posts/2018-01-29/install-openbsd-on-dedibox-with-full-disk-encryption/><h3 class="text-lg font-semibold mb-0.5">Install OpenBSD on dedibox with full-disk encryption</h3><div class="text-sm text-slate-500 dark:text-slate-400 line-clamp-2">TL;DR: I run several "dedibox" servers at online.net, all powered by OpenBSD.

Aaron Poffenberger wrote a shell-based `spf_fetch` utility. I wrote a C-based `spfwalk` utility that's `pledge()`-ed. The `spfwalk` utility got merged to `smtpctl`. What&rsquo;s SPF in a few words SPF is the Sender Policy Framework, a standard to verify the domain name of an e-mail sender.
Long story short, the SMTP protocol does not come with a way to authenticate a domain and, during an SMTP session, nothing really prevents a sender from pretending to come from any domain:</div></a><a class="article block px-3 py-4 hover:bg-slate-200 dark:hover:bg-slate-700" href=/posts/2018-01-08/news-from-the-front/><h3 class="text-lg font-semibold mb-0.5">News from the front !</h3><div class="text-sm text-slate-500 dark:text-slate-400 line-clamp-2">TL;DR: Came very close to a burn out late 2016, had to quit former employer.

Unlike most of our releases, it comes out with almost no new feature.
The changelog fits in less than 10 lines as follows:
- new fork+reexec model so each process has its own randomized memory space - logging format has been reworked - a "multi-line response" bug in the LMTP delivery backend has been fixed - connections concurrency limits have been bumped - artificial delaying in remote sessions have been reduced - dhparams option has been removed - dhe option has been added, supporting auto and legacy modes - smtp engine has been simplified - various cosmethic changes, code cleanup and documentation improvement Seems like a very productive slacking, however some of these changes turn out to be very interesting in terms of code simplification and security.</div></a><a class="article block px-3 py-4 hover:bg-slate-200 dark:hover:bg-slate-700" href=/posts/2015-12-22/home-sweet-home/><h3 class="text-lg font-semibold mb-0.5">Home, sweet home</h3><div class="text-sm text-slate-500 dark:text-slate-400 line-clamp-2">TL;DR: OpenSMTPD on github no longer diverges from OpenBSD. Since last episode Sometime this year, we released OpenSMTPD 5.7.1 which was the first version that shipped with the long-awaited experimental filters support. The result of over a year and a half of very very deep refactor in our IO layer and the addition of a very elegant but also very tricky new API.
This refactor took place outside the OpenBSD tree because it required breaking a lot of code for extended period of times, which spanned over 3 OpenBSD releases.</div></a><a class="article block px-3 py-4 hover:bg-slate-200 dark:hover:bg-slate-700" href=/posts/2014-12-12/the-state-of-filters/><h3 class="text-lg font-semibold mb-0.5">The state of filters</h3><div class="text-sm text-slate-500 dark:text-slate-400 line-clamp-2">TL;DR: yeeeees, filters are coming. don't believe us ? here's an example. be patient. On my death bed On my death bed, when my life flashes before my eyes and I start recalling what people have told me during my (hopefully long) lifetime, these sentences will single out:
&ldquo;When will OpenSMTPD support filters ? I need it.&rdquo;
Not that it carries a philosophical meaning that will have taken me a lifetime of thinking, but because for the last three years I have been hearing this every time I met someone IRL and discussed OpenSMTPD, I have read it on our Github issues tracker, on GTalk, on IRC, on Twitter, on Facebook, on random forums, and just this week three times in my mailbox.</div></a><a class="article block px-3 py-4 hover:bg-slate-200 dark:hover:bg-slate-700" href=/posts/2014-12-10/some-opensmtpd-overview-part-3/><h3 class="text-lg font-semibold mb-0.5">Some OpenSMTPD overview, part 3</h3><div class="text-sm text-slate-500 dark:text-slate-400 line-clamp-2">EHLO,
This is the third post of a series about OpenSMTPD improvements that have taken place since this summer.
Content altering For a long time, we have developed OpenSMTPD with a strict rule that the daemon should not alter DATA (as in the DATA SMTP phase) in any way.
The rationale was that by enforcing that rule, the message writing was simplified as the smtp process would simply read data from a client and write it, without any post-processing, to a file descriptor.</div></a><a class="article block px-3 py-4 hover:bg-slate-200 dark:hover:bg-slate-700" href=/posts/2014-12-01/some-opensmtpd-overview-part-2/><h3 class="text-lg font-semibold mb-0.5">Some OpenSMTPD overview, part 2</h3><div class="text-sm text-slate-500 dark:text-slate-400 line-clamp-2">Why we killed the MFA (filter) process For as long as I can remember, a process called MFA was created by OpenSMTPD at start time.
MFA stood for &ldquo;Mail Filter Agent&rdquo; and the goal of that process was initially to take care of all filtering tasks ranging from filtering senders based on the ruleset matching to starting and controlling filters.
As time passed by, we figured the lookup process was better suited for ruleset matching and the MFA process became mostly idle, we renamed it to &ldquo;filter&rdquo; process since the only thing it had to do was take care of starting filters and making sure they had the proper environment.</div></a><a class="article block px-3 py-4 hover:bg-slate-200 dark:hover:bg-slate-700" href=/posts/2014-11-26/some-opensmtpd-overview-part-1/><h3 class="text-lg font-semibold mb-0.5">Some OpenSMTPD overview, part 1</h3><div class="text-sm text-slate-500 dark:text-slate-400 line-clamp-2">EHLO world ! Yesterday I thought I&rsquo;d write a first OpenSMTPD-related post to sum up the changes that have happened since this summer but it turned out to be painful as they amount to quite a lot. Instead, I think a better strategy is to split this into a serie of smaller posts focused on the specific changes ;-)
So, in June I have organized a mini hackathon at my brand new place and invited some of the French Connection at home.</div></a><a class="article block px-3 py-4 hover:bg-slate-200 dark:hover:bg-slate-700" href=/posts/2014-11-24/what-the-fsck-did-just-happen/><h3 class="text-lg font-semibold mb-0.5">what the fsck did just happen</h3><div class="text-sm text-slate-500 dark:text-slate-400 line-clamp-2">Good news everyone !

I have not updated this blog since the release of OpenSMTPD 5.3, over a month ago. In the meantime, some minor bugs have been fixed and we have released OpenSMTPD 5.3.1.
The main reason for the silence is that I was busy with completely unrelated day-time work, unrelated opensource code, the OpenSMTPD book in progress and some minor health issues that have caused endless side-effects keeping my mind away from this blog.</div></a><a class="article block px-3 py-4 hover:bg-slate-200 dark:hover:bg-slate-700" href=/posts/2013-03-17/opensmtpd-5.3-released/><h3 class="text-lg font-semibold mb-0.5">OpenSMTPD 5.3 released</h3><div class="text-sm text-slate-500 dark:text-slate-400 line-clamp-2">OHAI !
I&rsquo;ve stayed silent for the last month as we got ready for the big thing&mldr;
Charles, Eric and I are proud to announce the release of OpenSMTPD 5.3, our first official production-ready release !
OpenSMTPD has been in use at poolp.org since 2008 and these last five years have seen a considerable amount of work. At various times we have been contemplating a release then delaying to add that one thing that seemed essential.</div></a><a class="article block px-3 py-4 hover:bg-slate-200 dark:hover:bg-slate-700" href=/posts/2013-02-02/opensmtpd-minor-fixes--preparing-release/><h3 class="text-lg font-semibold mb-0.5">OpenSMTPD: minor fixes + preparing release</h3><div class="text-sm text-slate-500 dark:text-slate-400 line-clamp-2">OHAI,
We had planned to slow down a bit to prepare for release: no more feature, no more invasive changes until we tag something out of which we can publish a release. I then discussed with Bret Lambert (blambert@) and he asked me if we used some kind of code scanner to detect defects in our code.
We do use the clang static analyzer every now and then, the last time being a couple week ago, and we spend a few minutes cleaning up the defects we believe to be real issues.</div></a><a class="article block px-3 py-4 hover:bg-slate-200 dark:hover:bg-slate-700" href=/posts/2013-01-25/opensmtpd-gentlemen-fasten-your-seatbelt/><h3 class="text-lg font-semibold mb-0.5">OpenSMTPD: gentlemen, fasten your seatbelt</h3><div class="text-sm text-slate-500 dark:text-slate-400 line-clamp-2">OHAI,
Lately we have stabilized and decided that we&rsquo;re okay with the features we have for our first release, this time for good, so we focused on making sure that we didn&rsquo;t introduce regressions and that we were rock solid.
We stressed incoming and outgoing path and found areas of improvements. This will be a long-standing task, but we have already improved memory usage considerably under high-load, we&rsquo;re pretty happy with the result.</div></a><a class="article block px-3 py-4 hover:bg-slate-200 dark:hover:bg-slate-700" href=/posts/2013-01-18/opensmtpd-stress-and-features/><h3 class="text-lg font-semibold mb-0.5">OpenSMTPD: stress and features</h3><div class="text-sm text-slate-500 dark:text-slate-400 line-clamp-2">&lt;p>Hey,&lt;/p> I wanted to publish something last Friday but I unfortunately got my hands on a copy of Super Nintendo's Zelda which led to an instant loss of motivation.
Here's a quick summary of what happened recently in OpenSMTPD-land, it's not an exhaustive description and to be honest I'm keeping a lot of information private at this point and probably until release ;-)
A snapshot should be published tomorrow.

I know I should have posted a &ldquo;Happy New Year&rdquo; note earlier but you know how it is: new year eve&rsquo;s aftermath, days to recover, work resumes, mood slacks, bleh.
Anyway, today&rsquo;s note is simply about that: wishing you and me an awesome year 2013 and hoping you will not turn it into a fucking mess. After all, you&rsquo;re in charge so we know who to blame ;-)
As far as I&rsquo;m concerned, year 2012 wasn&rsquo;t &ldquo;great&rdquo;, it was not the absolute suck either, it was even quite decent.</div></a><a class="article block px-3 py-4 hover:bg-slate-200 dark:hover:bg-slate-700" href=/posts/2012-12-28/opensmtpd-ssl-relay-stuff/><h3 class="text-lg font-semibold mb-0.5">OpenSMTPD: SSL & relay stuff</h3><div class="text-sm text-slate-500 dark:text-slate-400 line-clamp-2">OHAI,
I was unable to write a story last week as my desk broke into pieces for no apparent reason but my foot hitting it accidentally.
I still don&rsquo;t have a desk so I will make this short by not telling about the queue profiling and SQL log conversion I wrote, and not even writing about the filter work done by Eric, he&rsquo;ll write about it if he wants to or I&rsquo;ll do that next time.</div></a><a class="article block px-3 py-4 hover:bg-slate-200 dark:hover:bg-slate-700" href=/posts/2012-12-14/opensmtpd-ldap-support-selectable-source-dkim-and-goodies/><h3 class="text-lg font-semibold mb-0.5">OpenSMTPD: LDAP support, selectable source, DKIM and Goodies</h3><div class="text-sm text-slate-500 dark:text-slate-400 line-clamp-2">&lt;p>OHAI,&lt;/p> This week has been crazy, my brain melted a little as I worked on filters, it melted a little as I worked on LDAP and it melted a little more as I tried to trick Eric into working on filters with me (yes, that actually worked :-).
Anyway, as usual, this is just going to be a summary of what we did as tons of little stuff have been committed here and there.</div></a><a class="article block px-3 py-4 hover:bg-slate-200 dark:hover:bg-slate-700" href=/posts/2012-12-07/opensmtpd-fully-virtual-setups-updated-dns-mta-code-sqlite-support/><h3 class="text-lg font-semibold mb-0.5">OpenSMTPD: fully virtual setups, updated DNS & MTA code, SQLite support</h3><div class="text-sm text-slate-500 dark:text-slate-400 line-clamp-2">OHAI,
This week I had intended to work on filters. After 3 days of pain and swearing, even though it did move forward, I finally decided to step back for a few days and work on something else to preserve my sanity.
As you may have guessed, this week has not been too productive&mldr; Oh wait, yes it has ! It&rsquo;s actually been incredibly productive :-)
Just as usual, I will only write a summary for this week, the complete changelog can be retrieved from our mirror on Github.</div></a><a class="article block px-3 py-4 hover:bg-slate-200 dark:hover:bg-slate-700" href=/posts/2012-11-30/opensmtpd-more-features-more-cleanup-more-more/><h3 class="text-lg font-semibold mb-0.5">OpenSMTPD: more features, more cleanup, more more</h3><div class="text-sm text-slate-500 dark:text-slate-400 line-clamp-2">OHAI,
First of all, on a completely unrelated note, I&rsquo;d like to emphasize that this blog post is being written from my text editor launched by a little shell and pushed to poolp using the Ocean API. I can be web2.0 from console and emacs, and that&rsquo;s definitely worth a mention ;-)
As has become a habit, a lot of work has been poured in OpenSMTPD this week, here is an incomplete summary of the most notable changes.</div></a><a class="article block px-3 py-4 hover:bg-slate-200 dark:hover:bg-slate-700" href=/posts/2012-11-17/news-from-the-front/><h3 class="text-lg font-semibold mb-0.5">News from the front</h3><div class="text-sm text-slate-500 dark:text-slate-400 line-clamp-2">Almost a month since my last post&mldr; I know, I know.
So I left my position at Scality two weeks ago. I had been there for a year and a half working on a very interesting and tricky project. I will miss my colleagues and the discussions we had on all kinds of topic, I hope them the best future and that we will be able to share beers again ;-)</div></a><a class="article block px-3 py-4 hover:bg-slate-200 dark:hover:bg-slate-700" href=/posts/2012-08-31/opensmtpd-crypto/compress-fixes-and-import-initial-stab-at-ldap/><h3 class="text-lg font-semibold mb-0.5">OpenSMTPD: crypto/compress fixes and import initial stab at LDAP</h3><div class="text-sm text-slate-500 dark:text-slate-400 line-clamp-2">The crypto backend that has been committed a couple days ago started a little discussion and it was decided to switch the default cipher from Blowfish to AES-128 and make it a default.
Encryption can now be enabled as simply as:
queue encryption key &ldquo;foobar&rdquo;
That being said, Charles cleaned up a bit the compression code to make it use FILE* instead of file descriptors. This allows us to ensure we don&rsquo;t have to deal with any buffering and interruption handling code.</div></a><a class="article block px-3 py-4 hover:bg-slate-200 dark:hover:bg-slate-700" href=/posts/2012-08-29/opensmtpd-crypto_backend-and-encrypted-queue/><h3 class="text-lg font-semibold mb-0.5">OpenSMTPD: crypto_backend and encrypted queue</h3><div class="text-sm text-slate-500 dark:text-slate-400 line-clamp-2">A few days ago, Charles committed the compress_backend API which allowed transparent deflation/inflation of envelopes and messages as they hit the queue.
The compression code is executed before the queue_backend gets the data so that any queue_backend can benefit transparently from compression without having to add any code to handle it. Due to our design, this also means that if the queue_backend stores envelopes and messages remotely, then the compression will take place before sending and after fetching, the remote end only ever sees compressed data.</div></a><a class="article block px-3 py-4 hover:bg-slate-200 dark:hover:bg-slate-700" href=/posts/2012-08-26/opensmtpd-i-have-no-idea-for-that-title-sorry/><h3 class="text-lg font-semibold mb-0.5">OpenSMTPD: I have no idea for that title, sorry</h3><div class="text-sm text-slate-500 dark:text-slate-400 line-clamp-2">Howdie,
Eric and I had planned a loooooong time ago to have a hackathon this week-end. However, some asshole piece of shit ran into my car while it was parked, made it unable to take the road and flee without leaving a note. Long story made short, I had to be at the repair shop this week-end to be able to get my car before end of September.
We did get our hackathon though and while it was probably much less productive than if we had met in the same room, it was still very very interesting with tons of improvements and many great features written :-p</div></a><a class="article block px-3 py-4 hover:bg-slate-200 dark:hover:bg-slate-700" href=/posts/2012-08-21/opensmtpd-plenty-of-news/><h3 class="text-lg font-semibold mb-0.5">OpenSMTPD: plenty of news</h3><div class="text-sm text-slate-500 dark:text-slate-400 line-clamp-2">It&rsquo;s been over a month since my last post but I have an excuse: I was super busy, then I was super on vacation &mldr; but I&rsquo;m back again ;-)
So my life was pretty intense these last few weeks, both professionnally and on the opensource front. I&rsquo;ll explain later, for now let&rsquo;s just focus on the OpenSMTPD goodies.
OpenSMTPD portable to a new system First of all, I&rsquo;d like to stress out that Rune Lynge and Charles Longeau did an amazing job at porting OpenSMTPD to yet another system &mldr; MacOSX.</div></a><a class="article block px-3 py-4 hover:bg-slate-200 dark:hover:bg-slate-700" href=/posts/2012-07-15/g2k12-openbsd-hackathon-part-ii/><h3 class="text-lg font-semibold mb-0.5">g2k12: OpenBSD hackathon - part II</h3><div class="text-sm text-slate-500 dark:text-slate-400 line-clamp-2">Yesterday, I came back from Budapest and was too tired to write anything, but here&rsquo;s a quick summary of all the features that have been implemented with regard to OpenSMTPD by Eric, Charles and I.
First of all, Eric [eric@] has moved ASR, his asynchronous resolver, to OpenBSD&rsquo;s libc. This is a huge step forward that will allow OpenSMTPD to contain less code, while providing a better coverage of the resolver code.</div></a><a class="article block px-3 py-4 hover:bg-slate-200 dark:hover:bg-slate-700" href=/posts/2012-07-09/g2k12-openbsd-hackathon/><h3 class="text-lg font-semibold mb-0.5">g2k12: OpenBSD hackathon</h3><div class="text-sm text-slate-500 dark:text-slate-400 line-clamp-2">Yesterday, after nearly missing my plane by 5 minutes, I finally managed to make it to Budapest for g2k12, the OpenBSD general hackathon.
While this is not my first hackathon, this is the first general one with many hackers working on all kinds of subsystems ranging from ports to network and kernel. It&rsquo;s fun to see many people focused on improving different areas which you use daily, sometimes without even noticing, and doing it with as much fun as you are having fixing your own area ;-)</div></a><a class="article block px-3 py-4 hover:bg-slate-200 dark:hover:bg-slate-700" href=/posts/2012-06-19/opensmtpd-development-bug-tracker-github/><h3 class="text-lg font-semibold mb-0.5">OpenSMTPD: development, bug tracker & GitHub</h3><div class="text-sm text-slate-500 dark:text-slate-400 line-clamp-2">It&rsquo;s been a while since my last post about OpenSMTPD.
I don&rsquo;t know what Eric and Charles have been up to, I was quite busy with my daytime job and couldn&rsquo;t really spend much time on the hobby ;-)
Anyways, one of the most requested feature of OpenSMTPD is to provide users with a mean to report bugs and let them contribute more easily. It&rsquo;s been requested two times this week, it&rsquo;s been requested countless times in the last few weeks and months, and as a matter of fact it&rsquo;s also been a nuisance for us as until now we&rsquo;ve kept track of bugs and feature requests in my mailbox.</div></a><a class="article block px-3 py-4 hover:bg-slate-200 dark:hover:bg-slate-700" href=/posts/2012-06-06/opensmtpd-rest-queue/><h3 class="text-lg font-semibold mb-0.5">OpenSMTPD REST queue</h3><div class="text-sm text-slate-500 dark:text-slate-400 line-clamp-2">This is the first post of a series to illustrate and describe a &ldquo;proof of concept&rdquo; code by Charles, Eric and I. I will describe the features as they are implemented.
Since mid-November 2011, OpenSMTPD offers support for an extensible queue API. The queue_backend API allows a developer to write a custom storage driver by implementing a small set of functions that take care of storing, updating and removing envelopes and messages.</div></a><a class="article block px-3 py-4 hover:bg-slate-200 dark:hover:bg-slate-700" href=/posts/2012-05-17/opensmtpd-src-address-maps-and-spamhaus/><h3 class="text-lg font-semibold mb-0.5">OpenSMTPD: src-address maps and spamhaus</h3><div class="text-sm text-slate-500 dark:text-slate-400 line-clamp-2">First of all, I&rsquo;d like to &ldquo;thank&rdquo; The Spamhaus project which forced me into hacking this feature in a hurry.
See, I rent a server at online.net which I use for OpenSMTPD live testing and to run some experimental code before it hits the OpenBSD tree.
Yesterday I received a mail from a user complaining that he couldn&rsquo;t send mail to a friend because we were listed on spamhaus. That was very strange because ALL users at poolp.</div></a><a class="article block px-3 py-4 hover:bg-slate-200 dark:hover:bg-slate-700" href=/posts/2012-05-14/opensmtpd-relay-maps-new-url-syntax/><h3 class="text-lg font-semibold mb-0.5">OpenSMTPD relay maps & new url syntax</h3><div class="text-sm text-slate-500 dark:text-slate-400 line-clamp-2">When we first started working on OpenSMTPD, we planned for future features but we did not necessarily start integrating them right away as the goal was to bootstrap the project first with basic features.
Amongst these features was the ability to use mappings for outgoing MX servers. Currently, OpenSMTPD knows two ways of going out:
Using the DNS system to find MX records: accept for [&mldr;] relay
Using the provided mail exchanger: accept for [&mldr;] relay via &ldquo;my-mx.</div></a><a class="article block px-3 py-4 hover:bg-slate-200 dark:hover:bg-slate-700" href=/posts/2012-05-13/opensmtpd-map_compare-and-k_netaddr/><h3 class="text-lg font-semibold mb-0.5">OpenSMTPD, map_compare() and K_NETADDR</h3><div class="text-sm text-slate-500 dark:text-slate-400 line-clamp-2">Ok, I already posted about the new SQLite map_backend earlier today but it turns out that I&rsquo;ve been very productive, and it was worth another post ;-)
So I decided to start improving our maps support and make them usable from places where they weren&rsquo;t.
primary domains
OpenSMTPD supports two kinds of domains: primary domains and virtual domains. The primary domains do not require providing a list of recipients as it will use system accounts; whereas virtual domains require a list of recipients and/or a fallback address to be provided within a map.</div></a><a class="article block px-3 py-4 hover:bg-slate-200 dark:hover:bg-slate-700" href=/posts/2012-05-12/opensmtpd-meets-sqlite/><h3 class="text-lg font-semibold mb-0.5">OpenSMTPD meets SQLite</h3><div class="text-sm text-slate-500 dark:text-slate-400 line-clamp-2">During the r2k12 hackathon in Paris, Marc Espie committed SQLite to OpenBSD&rsquo;s base system.
This has the side effect that OpenSMTPD can start using it and while we agreed that we did not want it as a strong dependency, the various backends API allow us to make it a soft dependency that can be removed without breaking the daemon if someone really does not want SQLite linked.
Today I decided to give it a try and implement a SQLite backend to the map API.</div></a><a class="article block px-3 py-4 hover:bg-slate-200 dark:hover:bg-slate-700" href=/posts/2012-05-09/some-opensmtpd-news/><h3 class="text-lg font-semibold mb-0.5">Some OpenSMTPD news</h3><div class="text-sm text-slate-500 dark:text-slate-400 line-clamp-2">It&rsquo;s been a whiiiiiiile since my last OpenSMTPD related post. Time to break the slacking, blog-wise.
Unlike what would appear from the outside, there&rsquo;s been a lot of activity, discussions and planning, I&rsquo;ll address some here and will discuss it further soon.
First of all, chl@ has committed to a private branch a major improvement to the filter API: async DNS lookups. Due to the design of OpenSMTPD, it is not acceptable for a filter to perform a blocking call as it will prevent it from processing other sessions.</div></a><a class="article block px-3 py-4 hover:bg-slate-200 dark:hover:bg-slate-700" href=/posts/2005-05-21/fatigue-et-envie-de-vacances.../><h3 class="text-lg font-semibold mb-0.5">fatigue et envie de vacances...</h3><div class="text-sm text-slate-500 dark:text-slate-400 line-clamp-2">Je sais pas pourquoi, mais je suis epuise alors que j&rsquo;ai dormi pres de 14h cette nuit.

I&rsquo;ll post when I&rsquo;m happy with them too.</p><h1 id=split-indexes>Split indexes</h1><p>As a follow up to <a href=/posts/2022-04-24/april-2022-plakar.io-plakar-refactor-and-ssh-support/#reworked-internal-structures>refactor from previous month</a>,
I continued to work on improving the data structures used by plakar.</p><p>Just as I had split Index and Metadata,
I have now also split the Index and Filesystem view of a snapshot so <strong>a plakar snapshot now has three indexes</strong>:
<code>Metadata</code> contains, well, metadatas for lookups of general purpose informations regarding a snapshot,
<code>Index</code> contains everything necessary to figure out the structure of files and what&rsquo;s needed to reconstruct it,
and <code>Filesystem</code> contains everything necessary to figure otu the structure of snapshotted filesystems.</p><p>Basically,
if you want to know the size of a snapshot,
<code>Metadata</code> is the only index necessary.
If you want to figure out which chunks constitute <code>/etc/passwd</code>,
<code>Index</code> is the only index necessary.
If you want to figure out which files are in <code>/etc</code>,
or what were the permissions of <code>/etc/passwd</code>,
<code>Filesystem</code> is the only index necessary.
As most command only rely on one of these simultaneously,
this speeds up things as commands do not have to wait for the three indexes to be fetched before being able to work.</p><p>Not all commands benefit from this split yet as they need to be adapted,
but this will be a transparent change where some commands get a performance boost out of nowhere as I reimplement them properly.</p><h1 id=binary-indexes>Binary indexes</h1><p>Up until last month,
I had used <code>json</code> as the storage format for indexes,
and there were two reasons for that:</p><p>First, it allowed me to <strong>not worry too much about serialization</strong>.
I could simply json-marshal the <code>Metadata</code>, <code>Index</code> and <code>Filesystem</code> indexes which would generate a set of dictionnaries,
both usable with a simple json-unmarshal and no state &ldquo;rebuilding&rdquo; (that&rsquo;s converting from a disk format to different structures in memory, imposing a conversion cost).</p><p>Then, it also helped me debug things as I could always use an unencrypted plakar and rely on the <code>jq</code> command to read the indexes,
check that they contained the expected data and generally play with them with json-aware tools.</p><p>The problem is that <strong>json serialization and deserialization comes at a cost</strong>,
both in terms of space consumption as it&rsquo;s far from being a very compact format and snapshot may contain dozens of thousands of objects leading to a loooooooot of waste,
but also in terms of performances as the format itself is more costly to serialize and deserialize than binary formats.</p><p>I have ideas where I want to go with serialization of indexes but <strong>a good first step was to switch from json to a decent binary format</strong>,
one that would be more efficient to start with but which would also allow me to ensure that nothing relied on json anymore.</p><p>After some investigations,
I ran into <a href=https://msgpack.org target=_blank rel=noopener>&lt;code>msgpack&lt;/code></a> which seemed to be a good candidate,
was already fairly popular in other projects,
but more importantly didn&rsquo;t require too much work to plug in.</p><p>It claimed to provide much better performances than <code>json</code> serialization,
which I didn&rsquo;t observe myself,
but <strong>helped cut the index sizes considerably</strong> as in average it shrank them by 25% and up to 50% in some of my tests.</p><h1 id=compact-indexes>Compact indexes</h1><p>With work being done to split indexes and switch them to a binary format,
I decided to stay focused on index improvements and <strong>trying to make them as compact as I could</strong>.</p><p>The reason is that <strong>indexes weight &ldquo;two&rdquo; sizes</strong>:
the storage size, when they&rsquo;re written to disk, and the runtime size, when they&rsquo;re loaded into memory.
Both these sizes have benefits being optimized,
the former allowing faster deserialization,
the latter providing a smaller footprint and faster serialization.</p><p>In an ideal world,
the data structures stored on disk are compressed to the smallest possible size to reduce loading time,
but <strong>the data structures loaded in memory should be as close as possible to their disk counterparts to avoid conversion costs</strong>.
The optimal case would be that indexes are compressed in such a way that they can be loaded compressed in memory,
and usable without decompressing them.</p><p>So first of all,
I did a pass to compress data types as I knew there would be an instant gain from a (seemingly) simple change.
The project uses <code>uuid</code> (16 bytes) and <code>sha256</code> sums (32 bytes) all over the place,
but for convenience I used <strong>human-readable representations of these formats</strong>,
that is 36-bytes strings for <code>uuid</code> and 64-bytes strings for <code>sha256</code>.
These landed in many data structures in their human-readable representation,
meaning that <strong>20 bytes were wasted every time a <code>uuid</code> was stored and 32 bytes were wasted every time a sum was stored</strong>.
This doesn&rsquo;t look much but that&rsquo;s until you realize that <em>most</em> of what&rsquo;s stored in the indexes are mappings that associate sums to each others,
so when a snapshot contains dozens of thousands of files the waste builds up:
<strong>gain was already quite nice at this point as it halved the size of indexes</strong> on the snapshots of my work directory.</p><p>Then,
I did another pass to compress index size further.
As I wrote above, most of what&rsquo;s stored in indexes are mappings that associate sums to each others,
and to achieve that there are several mappings and reverse mappings which tend to repeat the same information in reverse order.
To answer questions such as <code>what are the chunks in object X ?</code> or <code>what objects contain the chunk Y ?</code>,
you need to have a mapping associating the checksum of object X to a serie of chunk checksums,
but also to have a mapping associating the checksum of chunk Y to a serie of object checksums.
<strong>This means that a ton of 32-byte checksums are repeated duplicated and appear <em>at least</em> twice in indexes</strong>.
By using a symbol table and an indirection,
it is possible to reduce the index sizes by replacing 32-byte checksums with a much smaller and unique 8-byte identifier.
Because each checksums appear at least twice,
the index shrinks by <em>roughly</em> 50% <em>in the worse case</em> and is effectively compressed in memory.
at the cost of a <code>O(1)</code> indirection in the symbol table.</p><p>These were <strong>cumulative</strong> so by the end of this round of optimizations,
indexes were <strong>about 4x times smaller than what they were to start with</strong>,
and because of how the compression works it also means they don&rsquo;t grow as much as they used to.</p><p>I still have ideas to improve further on indexes compression,
but at this point I&rsquo;m satisfied with what I have and the current trade-off ratio between size and convenience.
I know I have some improvement margin still but will only use it if absolutely necessary.</p><h1 id=display-index-filesystem-and-metadata>Display index, filesystem and metadata</h1><p>Because the changes above made it harder to investigate the content of indexes,
as they are no longer stored in a human-readable format,
I implemented a helper command to json-dump their content allowing to inspect them with:</p><pre tabindex=0><code>% plakar info -metadata 39| jq .|grep IndexID

It&rsquo;s a bit hard to write about this feature,
so feel free to look at the output of these commands by yourself.</p><h1 id=performances-profiling-and-cache>Performances, profiling and cache</h1><p>I did something I had not done before:
try an alternate solution to plakar and <strong>compare runtime execution timings</strong>.</p><p>I expected plakar to be a bit slower because it lacks maturity and I didn&rsquo;t spend much time optimizing yet,
but <strong>I intuitively thought it would be roughly 25% slower</strong> with an easily achievable margin of improvement.</p><p>I installed <code>restic</code> and after a few minutes of reading documentation to figure out the command line interface,
I ran a couple snapshots&mldr; <strong>and was left speechless</strong>.
It was <em>considerably</em> faster, not by 25% but more like 25x faster.
To be more precise,
the initial snapshot was about 25% faster than with plakar,
which was what I expected it to be&mldr;
but subsequent snapshots took only a couple seconds when they could take a minute with plakar.
<strong>I honestly didn&rsquo;t think they could be so fast.</strong></p><p>After a few seconds of contemplation and investigation to make sure that I didn&rsquo;t miss something on the command line and that it <em>actually</em> did the subsequent snapshots,
I decided to do a first pass of optimization right away to bring my plakar timings at least in the 25% range.
<strong>I didn&rsquo;t want to work on optimization right away</strong>,
because it would be premature with all of the changes still happening,
and I don&rsquo;t want them to go in the way of design at this point&mldr;
but I also didn&rsquo;t want to create a situation were the design would lock me too far from alternatives performance-wise.
I mainly <strong>needed reassurance that suboptimal performances remained in the realm of achievable improvements</strong> when I&rsquo;ll be tackling them.</p><p>I wrote a runtime profiling mechanism,
that you can enable with the <code>-profiling</code>,
and which allowed me to track what were the main areas that needed improvements:</p><pre tabindex=0><code>% plakar -profiling push

</code></pre><p>This made me realize that this very high performance gap was caused by <strong>a major difference in what it did</strong> compared to restic.
It attempted to maintain repository consistency with every operation,
using complex sequences of operations to maintain correct reference counts,
ensuring that objects were deleted as soon as they were no longer referenced or when a push was aborted,
etc&mldr; while restic didn&rsquo;t take care of that with every operation but used a <code>prune</code> command to do the cleanup.</p><p>I really thought it would be neat to keep the repository consistency the way plakar did,
but it became obvious that the cost was too prohibitive and no amount of optimizations I could think of would counterweight the cost of this.
All operations <strong>were made more complex and the cost of consistency was paid with every call</strong>,
when restic benefited from <strong>simpler operations and the cost of consistency was paid only when actually requested</strong>.</p><p>I backtracked on my ideas and <strong>reimplemented plakar&rsquo;s <code>push</code> using a much simpler strategy</strong>,
removing all attempts at playing hard-links and reference counts games to track and cleanup,
but implementing a cleanup operation like restic did.</p><p>This <strong>immediately brought a huge improvement</strong> as plakar remained in the range of 25% for the first push (with some gain though),
but immediately fell to the same performances as restic for subsequent pushes.
This looks promising because while it has roughly the same timings,
unlike restic,
plakar uses compression by default and didn&rsquo;t go through actual optimization yet.
This means that performances will likely put it below restic in terms of push times,
while repository consumption is already much better when snapshots are compressible.
I played a lot with pushing my ~2GB work directory and for the same push time,
it would weight ~2GB on restic and only 350MB on plakar.</p><p>While I was there,
I had a look at the repository structure by poking at the created directories and realized that despite a few differences both were very,
very,
very close.
This gave me confidence that I was not completely off with how I tackled this project :-)</p><p>The profiler also helped me realize that <strong>there was a bug in the implementation of the local cache</strong>.
It is implemented using SQLite and I didn&rsquo;t create the proper indexes,
which caused cache accesses to be very costly and negated the benefits of using one as soon as there were a lot of data in it.
After fixing,
things were much better but I came to the conclusion that SQLite was not the proper tool for my problem,
<strong>what I really need is a very simple key-value database</strong>.
I temporarily replaced SQLite with LevelDB for the sake experimenting,
but am not too happy as it imposes a lock that makes the cache unusable for reads when a push is in progress.
For the time being I made it so the cache is skipped while a push is in progress,
I&rsquo;ll be looking at a different solution that allows reads of older versions of the data when a write is in progress.</p><h1 id=parallelized-pull>Parallelized pull</h1><p>The <code>plakar pull</code> operation was not parallelized so while a <code>push</code> could benefit from multiple cores,
<strong><code>pull</code> would restore snapshot content sequentially and one file at at time</strong>.</p><p>I rewrote it so that it would both take advantage of the snapshot Reader interface <a href=/posts/2022-04-24/april-2022-plakar.io-plakar-refactor-and-ssh-support/#implemented-a-reader-interface>I wrote about last month</a>,
simplifying code,
but also so that it could parallelize restoring and speed things up.</p><p>There are other things that can be done to speed up things,
like not restoring files which are already there in their last version in the target directory,
or looking at stat structure to figure out if some files are hard links to others.
Work still needs to be done but it&rsquo;s already a better version so&mldr;
meh, no rush.</p><h1 id=added-a-progress-bar>Added a progress bar</h1><p>That&rsquo;s a minor change but one that I really wanted to do and which someone asked me for,
prompting me to start working on it.</p><center><img src=cover.png></center><br><p>I implemented the <code>-progress</code> option for <code>plakar push</code>, <code>plakar pull</code> and <code>plakar check</code>,
but I&rsquo;m not too happy with the way I achieved it.
I&rsquo;ll revisit later but thought I&rsquo;d leave it as is for now as it&rsquo;s still more helpful than not having it.</p><h1 id=reworked-clone-and-sync>Reworked clone and sync</h1><p>OK, this is <strong>by far the most interesting feature in my opinion</strong>.</p><p>The goal of <code>plakar clone</code> is to create an exact copy of an existing repository,
sharing its repository ID and configuration,
including encryption key.</p><p>The goal of <code>plakar sync</code> is to synchronize two repositories by transfering the chunks and objects that are missing in the target repository,
effectively making an exact copy of a snapshot available in a different repository.</p><p>I had already implemented <code>plakar clone</code> and <code>plakar sync</code> but they <strong>both had shortcomings</strong>.
First, they both only supported working with local repositories, <strong>ones available on the local filesystem</strong>.
Then, <code>sync</code> only supported synchronizing to clone repositories or between unencrypted repositories,
but it <strong>didn&rsquo;t support synchronizing an unencrypted repository with an encrypted one for example</strong>.
This was nice already but what I really wanted was for this to work regardless of where a repository is,
and regardless of the configuration of both repositories.</p><p>I reworked both commands so that they know support working with <strong>arbitrary repositories</strong>,
and doing the necessary work so there&rsquo;s no issue when synchronizing repositories not sharing the same configuration.</p><p>Why is this the most interesting feature in my opinion ?</p><p>Well what I <em>really</em> want with backups is the ability to <strong>have them at multiple locations</strong>,
preferably in different regions.
I&rsquo;ve already lost a few servers at cheap hosts where no disk recovery was offered,
and I know of at least one DC that burnt and lost data of all local servers in the process,
killing backups that were located on different machines of the same DC.
I want to be able to <strong>spread backups at multiple locations</strong> but <strong>I don&rsquo;t want to have to think too hard</strong> about that.</p><p>Furthermore,
I&rsquo;m not necessarily interested in having ALL backups encrypted,
nor synchronized at the same rate.
For instance,
I like having <strong>backups on my local machine</strong> readily available in case I mistakenly trash something,
I like having <strong>unencrypted backups on my NAS</strong> at home in case a machine is unrecoverable,
but I&rsquo;d also like having <strong>off-site encrypted backups at one or two cheap hosts</strong> in case there was a fire at home and I lost everything.
<strong>Not all these backups need to happen at the same frequency</strong> and I don&rsquo;t want to have complex strategies here and there,
depending on the machine.
I can do that with several solutions and a bunch of scripting,
but I&rsquo;ve been there,
done that,
and it was never fun.</p><p>What <code>clone</code> and <code>sync</code> allow me to do is to have exactly what I described in just a few commands,
I can create an unencrypted repository on my laptop:</p><pre tabindex=0><code>% plakar on ~/plakar create -no-encryption
</code></pre><p>Then create a clone on my NAS:</p><pre tabindex=0><code>% plakar on ~/plakar clone to ssh://nas.poolp.org
</code></pre><p>Both repositories are absolutely identical at this point.</p><p>My laptop can do a <code>plakar push</code> multiple times a day from a cron,
then every few hours I can synchronize both repositories:</p><pre tabindex=0><code>% plakar on ~/plakar sync to ssh://nas.poolp.org
</code></pre><p>which brings the NAS repository up-to-date with the local repository.
I could also synchronize the other way.
Say I had multiple machines pushing to the NAS and I wanted my local repository to grab all snapshots,
then I&rsquo;d just:</p><pre tabindex=0><code>% plakar on ~/plakar sync from ssh://nas.poolp.org
</code></pre><p>which brings the local repository up-to-date with the NAS repository.
Just like I could clone the NAS repository to bring back an exact copy if I had reinstalled my machine:</p><pre tabindex=0><code>% plakar on ~/plakar clone from ssh://nas.poolp.org
</code></pre><p>But where I find it very useful is that I could create encrypted repositories remotely:</p><pre tabindex=0><code>% plakar on ssh://backups.poolp.org create
password:
</code></pre><p>and synchronize either my NAS or laptop with them:</p><pre tabindex=0><code>% plakar on ~/plakar sync to ssh://backups.poolp.org
password:
% plakar on ssh://nas.local sync to ssh://backups.poolp.org
password:
</code></pre><p>The <code>-keyfile</code> option can be provided to point to a file containing the password so it doesn&rsquo;t need to be typed,
and allows calling sync from a cron job.</p><p>With all of this,
<strong>it makes it trivial to have multi-site backups all synchronized one with another at different rates</strong>.</p><h1 id=reworked-snapshot-reader>Reworked snapshot Reader</h1><p>Last month,
I wrote about how <a href=/posts/2022-04-24/april-2022-plakar.io-plakar-refactor-and-ssh-support/#implemented-a-reader-interface>I implemented a snapshot Reader interface</a> and how it helped unlock features and simplify code.</p><p>The next feature I&rsquo;ll write about required me to rework the Reader interface.
A Reader interface is one that allows a <code>Read()</code> operation,
but I really needed a ReadSeekCloser interface,
one that allows <code>Read()</code>, <code>Close()</code> and more importantly <code>Seek()</code> so that <strong>I can move the read cursor to arbitrary locations in a stream</strong>.</p><p>I wrote the interface to implement <code>Seek()</code> on an object so that it would locate the appropriate chunk and maintain an offset to point at the proper position.
This didn&rsquo;t take too long as I did it in an hour or so,
but <strong>it was painful and I lost my soul in the process</strong>.</p><h1 id=fuse-proof-of-concept>FUSE proof-of-concept</h1><p>FUSE is a &ldquo;Filesystem in USEerspace&rdquo; mechanism which <strong>allows creating mountpoints that expose informations as if they were files on the filesystem</strong>.
It&rsquo;s not available on all systems,
but when it is,
fun stuff are available to play with.</p><p>I implemented experimental FUSE support in plakar,
making it possible to mount a repository on the filesystem and browse it <strong>as if all snapshots had been restored</strong> there.</p><p>What this means is that I can do:</p><pre tabindex=0><code>% plakar on ssh://nas.local mount /mnt/nas
</code></pre><p>Then I can browse just as if all the repository had been restored below <code>/mnt/nas</code>:</p><pre tabindex=0><code>% ls -l /mnt/nas

</code></pre><p>This was <strong>not committed and I have no plans to commit it for the time being</strong>,
a lot of work still needs to be done before I focus on such features,
but it shows how plakar can be improved in ways that my current rsync/tar backups will never match.</p><h1 id=s3-experiment>S3 experiment</h1><p>I also did a small experiment writing an s3 backend for plakar,
<strong>allowing it to store repositories on Amazon s3 or on a <a href=https://min.io target=_blank rel=noopener>&lt;code>minio&lt;/code> server</a></strong>.</p><p>I&rsquo;m not too comfortable with the API as I never used s3 before,
surely I&rsquo;m not using it correctly,
but someone asked me if this would be supported and so I gave it a try.</p><p>After about half an hour,
I had a plakar repository hosted on a local s3:</p><pre tabindex=0><code>% plakar on s3://minioadmin:minioadmin@localhost:9000/my-s3-plakar create -no-encryption
% plakar on s3://minioadmin:minioadmin@localhost:9000/my-s3-plakar push /private/etc 2&gt;/dev/null
% plakar on s3://minioadmin:minioadmin@localhost:9000/my-s3-plakar ls

I doubt I&rsquo;ll find much spare time to write code this month&mldr;
just as I think the month of July will be needed to recover as a wedding is a lot to deal with for someone with an anxiety disorder :-)</p><p>Stay tuned,
I&rsquo;ll post as soon as I resume my work !</p><hr><p>Comments: <a href=https://github.com/poolpOrg/poolp.org/discussions/152 target=_blank rel=noopener>https://github.com/poolpOrg/poolp.org/discussions/152</a></p><script src=https://giscus.app/client.js data-repo=poolpOrg/poolp.org data-repo-id="MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMjYxODk2MjA=" data-category=Articles data-category-id=DIC_kwDOB4WANM4B-Zf1 data-mapping=og:title data-strict=0 data-reactions-enabled=1 data-emit-metadata=1 data-input-position=top data-theme=light data-lang=en data-loading=lazy crossorigin=anonymous async></script></article></div></div><script type=text/javascript src=/main.js defer></script></body></html>
