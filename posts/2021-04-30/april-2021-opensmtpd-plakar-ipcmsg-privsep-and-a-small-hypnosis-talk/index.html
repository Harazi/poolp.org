This post won't need a TL;DR as I'll keep it short. Generalized anxiety disorder and alexithymia. Late 2018, I&rsquo;ve been diagnosed with generalized anxiety disorder and alexithymia a couple weeks apart.
The anxiety disorder didn&rsquo;t really come as a surprise as I know very well the traumatic experience that led to the disorder. It&rsquo;ll still take a lot of hours of hypnosis to continue cleaning up trauma after trauma, but taking care of it and releasing some of the traumas has improved considerably my anxiety.</div></a><a class="article block px-3 py-4 hover:bg-slate-200 dark:hover:bg-slate-700" href=/posts/2018-12-21/opensmtpd-now-supports-regex-in-match-rules/><h3 class="text-lg font-semibold mb-0.5">OpenSMTPD now supports regex in match rules</h3><div class="text-sm text-slate-500 dark:text-slate-400 line-clamp-2">TL;DR: regex table lookups were introduced for builtin filters. After a few weeks of working solely on filters, I wanted to work on something else. Using the same mechanism, all match criterias using tables can support regex. K_REGEX lookups The table mechanism is used within OpenSMTPD to perform all kinds of lookups.
Recently, while working on builtin filters, I introduced the K_REGEX lookup type allowing tables to serve regex(3) patterns.</div></a><a class="article block px-3 py-4 hover:bg-slate-200 dark:hover:bg-slate-700" href=/posts/2018-12-19/more-on-opensmtpd-filters/><h3 class="text-lg font-semibold mb-0.5">more on OpenSMTPD filters</h3><div class="text-sm text-slate-500 dark:text-slate-400 line-clamp-2">TL;DR: Not this time, pal/gal, I took hours writing this post, you'll take a few minutes reading it all. Oh, and merry X-mas :-* A bit of short-sighted history The filtering feature has been introduced only recently in OpenSMTPD, first presented on this blog a month ago.
I had a working proof-of-concept running on my laptop and my plan was to start bringing the code to the OpenBSD tree, small chunks by small chunks, through a serie of diffs.</div></a><a class="article block px-3 py-4 hover:bg-slate-200 dark:hover:bg-slate-700" href=/posts/2018-12-06/opensmtpd-proc-filters-fc-rdns/><h3 class="text-lg font-semibold mb-0.5">OpenSMTPD proc filters & fc-rDNS</h3><div class="text-sm text-slate-500 dark:text-slate-400 line-clamp-2">TL;DR: I *FINALFUCKINGLY* commited proc filters support allowing full filtering in OpenSMTPD. eric@ implemented fc-rDNS lookups. fc-rDNS fc-rDNS, or forward-confirmed reverse DNS, consists in performing a reverse DNS lookup to determine the hostname associated to an IP address&mldr; then performing a DNS lookup on that hostname to check if it resolves back to the IP address.
On my request, eric@ implemented fc-rDNS lookups in our SMTP engine, causing OpenSMTPD to perform the double lookup upon clients connections.</div></a><a class="article block px-3 py-4 hover:bg-slate-200 dark:hover:bg-slate-700" href=/posts/2018-11-09/opensmtpd-reporting-update/><h3 class="text-lg font-semibold mb-0.5">OpenSMTPD reporting update</h3><div class="text-sm text-slate-500 dark:text-slate-400 line-clamp-2">TL;DR: The reporting mechanism has been described shortly in my previous article about both reporting and filters. Let's focus a bit more on the reporting bits this time. The format is improving further and has extended to outgoing trafic reporting. Reporting In previous article, I described the events reporting mechanism that has been introduced in the development branch of OpenSMTPD.
To sum it up, you could now write an event processor as simple as a shell script reading its stdin on a loop:</div></a><a class="article block px-3 py-4 hover:bg-slate-200 dark:hover:bg-slate-700" href=/posts/2018-11-03/opensmtpd-released-and-upcoming-filters-preview/><h3 class="text-lg font-semibold mb-0.5">OpenSMTPD released and upcoming filters preview</h3><div class="text-sm text-slate-500 dark:text-slate-400 line-clamp-2">TL;DR: Filters have been a (the most ?) long awaited feature in OpenSMTPD.

OpenSMTPD 6.4.0 was released ! We have released OpenSMTPD 6.4.0 last week without filters.
I won&rsquo;t expand on the features in the 6.</div></a><a class="article block px-3 py-4 hover:bg-slate-200 dark:hover:bg-slate-700" href=/posts/2018-05-21/switching-to-opensmtpd-new-config/><h3 class="text-lg font-semibold mb-0.5">switching to OpenSMTPD new config</h3><div class="text-sm text-slate-500 dark:text-slate-400 line-clamp-2">TL;DR: Switching to new config is not too hard and can be done in minutes. The new config is also a new queue that is not backwards compatible. The easiest way is to flush the mail queue before switching. We came up with a solution to help maintainers of more complex setups. Switching from old config to new config The new OpenSMTPD configuration grammar is slightly different from the current one, rules are no longer stated as single lines, but the conversion from previous ruleset to new ruleset isn&rsquo;t that hard.</div></a><a class="article block px-3 py-4 hover:bg-slate-200 dark:hover:bg-slate-700" href=/posts/2018-04-30/opensmtpd-new-config/><h3 class="text-lg font-semibold mb-0.5">OpenSMTPD new config</h3><div class="text-sm text-slate-500 dark:text-slate-400 line-clamp-2">TL;DR: OpenBSD #p2k18 hackathon took place at Epitech in Nantes. I was organizing the hackathon but managed to make progress on OpenSMTPD. As mentionned at EuroBSDCon the one-line per rule config format was a design error. A new configuration grammar is almost ready and the underlying structures are simplified. Refactor removes ~750 lines of code and solves _many_ issues that were side-effects of the design error. New features are going to be unlocked thanks to this.</div></a><a class="article block px-3 py-4 hover:bg-slate-200 dark:hover:bg-slate-700" href=/posts/2018-01-29/install-openbsd-on-dedibox-with-full-disk-encryption/><h3 class="text-lg font-semibold mb-0.5">Install OpenBSD on dedibox with full-disk encryption</h3><div class="text-sm text-slate-500 dark:text-slate-400 line-clamp-2">TL;DR: I run several "dedibox" servers at online.net, all powered by OpenBSD.

Aaron Poffenberger wrote a shell-based `spf_fetch` utility. I wrote a C-based `spfwalk` utility that's `pledge()`-ed. The `spfwalk` utility got merged to `smtpctl`. What&rsquo;s SPF in a few words SPF is the Sender Policy Framework, a standard to verify the domain name of an e-mail sender.
Long story short, the SMTP protocol does not come with a way to authenticate a domain and, during an SMTP session, nothing really prevents a sender from pretending to come from any domain:</div></a><a class="article block px-3 py-4 hover:bg-slate-200 dark:hover:bg-slate-700" href=/posts/2018-01-08/news-from-the-front/><h3 class="text-lg font-semibold mb-0.5">News from the front !</h3><div class="text-sm text-slate-500 dark:text-slate-400 line-clamp-2">TL;DR: Came very close to a burn out late 2016, had to quit former employer.

Unlike most of our releases, it comes out with almost no new feature.
The changelog fits in less than 10 lines as follows:
- new fork+reexec model so each process has its own randomized memory space - logging format has been reworked - a "multi-line response" bug in the LMTP delivery backend has been fixed - connections concurrency limits have been bumped - artificial delaying in remote sessions have been reduced - dhparams option has been removed - dhe option has been added, supporting auto and legacy modes - smtp engine has been simplified - various cosmethic changes, code cleanup and documentation improvement Seems like a very productive slacking, however some of these changes turn out to be very interesting in terms of code simplification and security.</div></a><a class="article block px-3 py-4 hover:bg-slate-200 dark:hover:bg-slate-700" href=/posts/2015-12-22/home-sweet-home/><h3 class="text-lg font-semibold mb-0.5">Home, sweet home</h3><div class="text-sm text-slate-500 dark:text-slate-400 line-clamp-2">TL;DR: OpenSMTPD on github no longer diverges from OpenBSD. Since last episode Sometime this year, we released OpenSMTPD 5.7.1 which was the first version that shipped with the long-awaited experimental filters support. The result of over a year and a half of very very deep refactor in our IO layer and the addition of a very elegant but also very tricky new API.
This refactor took place outside the OpenBSD tree because it required breaking a lot of code for extended period of times, which spanned over 3 OpenBSD releases.</div></a><a class="article block px-3 py-4 hover:bg-slate-200 dark:hover:bg-slate-700" href=/posts/2014-12-12/the-state-of-filters/><h3 class="text-lg font-semibold mb-0.5">The state of filters</h3><div class="text-sm text-slate-500 dark:text-slate-400 line-clamp-2">TL;DR: yeeeees, filters are coming. don't believe us ? here's an example. be patient. On my death bed On my death bed, when my life flashes before my eyes and I start recalling what people have told me during my (hopefully long) lifetime, these sentences will single out:
&ldquo;When will OpenSMTPD support filters ? I need it.&rdquo;
Not that it carries a philosophical meaning that will have taken me a lifetime of thinking, but because for the last three years I have been hearing this every time I met someone IRL and discussed OpenSMTPD, I have read it on our Github issues tracker, on GTalk, on IRC, on Twitter, on Facebook, on random forums, and just this week three times in my mailbox.</div></a><a class="article block px-3 py-4 hover:bg-slate-200 dark:hover:bg-slate-700" href=/posts/2014-12-10/some-opensmtpd-overview-part-3/><h3 class="text-lg font-semibold mb-0.5">Some OpenSMTPD overview, part 3</h3><div class="text-sm text-slate-500 dark:text-slate-400 line-clamp-2">EHLO,
This is the third post of a series about OpenSMTPD improvements that have taken place since this summer.
Content altering For a long time, we have developed OpenSMTPD with a strict rule that the daemon should not alter DATA (as in the DATA SMTP phase) in any way.
The rationale was that by enforcing that rule, the message writing was simplified as the smtp process would simply read data from a client and write it, without any post-processing, to a file descriptor.</div></a><a class="article block px-3 py-4 hover:bg-slate-200 dark:hover:bg-slate-700" href=/posts/2014-12-01/some-opensmtpd-overview-part-2/><h3 class="text-lg font-semibold mb-0.5">Some OpenSMTPD overview, part 2</h3><div class="text-sm text-slate-500 dark:text-slate-400 line-clamp-2">Why we killed the MFA (filter) process For as long as I can remember, a process called MFA was created by OpenSMTPD at start time.
MFA stood for &ldquo;Mail Filter Agent&rdquo; and the goal of that process was initially to take care of all filtering tasks ranging from filtering senders based on the ruleset matching to starting and controlling filters.
As time passed by, we figured the lookup process was better suited for ruleset matching and the MFA process became mostly idle, we renamed it to &ldquo;filter&rdquo; process since the only thing it had to do was take care of starting filters and making sure they had the proper environment.</div></a><a class="article block px-3 py-4 hover:bg-slate-200 dark:hover:bg-slate-700" href=/posts/2014-11-26/some-opensmtpd-overview-part-1/><h3 class="text-lg font-semibold mb-0.5">Some OpenSMTPD overview, part 1</h3><div class="text-sm text-slate-500 dark:text-slate-400 line-clamp-2">EHLO world ! Yesterday I thought I&rsquo;d write a first OpenSMTPD-related post to sum up the changes that have happened since this summer but it turned out to be painful as they amount to quite a lot. Instead, I think a better strategy is to split this into a serie of smaller posts focused on the specific changes ;-)
So, in June I have organized a mini hackathon at my brand new place and invited some of the French Connection at home.</div></a><a class="article block px-3 py-4 hover:bg-slate-200 dark:hover:bg-slate-700" href=/posts/2014-11-24/what-the-fsck-did-just-happen/><h3 class="text-lg font-semibold mb-0.5">what the fsck did just happen</h3><div class="text-sm text-slate-500 dark:text-slate-400 line-clamp-2">Good news everyone !

OpenSMTPD has been in use at poolp.org since 2008 and these last five years have seen a considerable amount of work. At various times we have been contemplating a release then delaying to add that one thing that seemed essential.</div></a><a class="article block px-3 py-4 hover:bg-slate-200 dark:hover:bg-slate-700" href=/posts/2013-02-02/opensmtpd-minor-fixes--preparing-release/><h3 class="text-lg font-semibold mb-0.5">OpenSMTPD: minor fixes + preparing release</h3><div class="text-sm text-slate-500 dark:text-slate-400 line-clamp-2">OHAI,
We had planned to slow down a bit to prepare for release: no more feature, no more invasive changes until we tag something out of which we can publish a release. I then discussed with Bret Lambert (blambert@) and he asked me if we used some kind of code scanner to detect defects in our code.
We do use the clang static analyzer every now and then, the last time being a couple week ago, and we spend a few minutes cleaning up the defects we believe to be real issues.</div></a><a class="article block px-3 py-4 hover:bg-slate-200 dark:hover:bg-slate-700" href=/posts/2013-01-25/opensmtpd-gentlemen-fasten-your-seatbelt/><h3 class="text-lg font-semibold mb-0.5">OpenSMTPD: gentlemen, fasten your seatbelt</h3><div class="text-sm text-slate-500 dark:text-slate-400 line-clamp-2">OHAI,
Lately we have stabilized and decided that we&rsquo;re okay with the features we have for our first release, this time for good, so we focused on making sure that we didn&rsquo;t introduce regressions and that we were rock solid.
We stressed incoming and outgoing path and found areas of improvements. This will be a long-standing task, but we have already improved memory usage considerably under high-load, we&rsquo;re pretty happy with the result.</div></a><a class="article block px-3 py-4 hover:bg-slate-200 dark:hover:bg-slate-700" href=/posts/2013-01-18/opensmtpd-stress-and-features/><h3 class="text-lg font-semibold mb-0.5">OpenSMTPD: stress and features</h3><div class="text-sm text-slate-500 dark:text-slate-400 line-clamp-2">&lt;p>Hey,&lt;/p> I wanted to publish something last Friday but I unfortunately got my hands on a copy of Super Nintendo's Zelda which led to an instant loss of motivation.
Here's a quick summary of what happened recently in OpenSMTPD-land, it's not an exhaustive description and to be honest I'm keeping a lot of information private at this point and probably until release ;-)
A snapshot should be published tomorrow.

I know I should have posted a &ldquo;Happy New Year&rdquo; note earlier but you know how it is: new year eve&rsquo;s aftermath, days to recover, work resumes, mood slacks, bleh.
Anyway, today&rsquo;s note is simply about that: wishing you and me an awesome year 2013 and hoping you will not turn it into a fucking mess. After all, you&rsquo;re in charge so we know who to blame ;-)
As far as I&rsquo;m concerned, year 2012 wasn&rsquo;t &ldquo;great&rdquo;, it was not the absolute suck either, it was even quite decent.</div></a><a class="article block px-3 py-4 hover:bg-slate-200 dark:hover:bg-slate-700" href=/posts/2012-12-28/opensmtpd-ssl-relay-stuff/><h3 class="text-lg font-semibold mb-0.5">OpenSMTPD: SSL & relay stuff</h3><div class="text-sm text-slate-500 dark:text-slate-400 line-clamp-2">OHAI,
I was unable to write a story last week as my desk broke into pieces for no apparent reason but my foot hitting it accidentally.
I still don&rsquo;t have a desk so I will make this short by not telling about the queue profiling and SQL log conversion I wrote, and not even writing about the filter work done by Eric, he&rsquo;ll write about it if he wants to or I&rsquo;ll do that next time.</div></a><a class="article block px-3 py-4 hover:bg-slate-200 dark:hover:bg-slate-700" href=/posts/2012-12-14/opensmtpd-ldap-support-selectable-source-dkim-and-goodies/><h3 class="text-lg font-semibold mb-0.5">OpenSMTPD: LDAP support, selectable source, DKIM and Goodies</h3><div class="text-sm text-slate-500 dark:text-slate-400 line-clamp-2">&lt;p>OHAI,&lt;/p> This week has been crazy, my brain melted a little as I worked on filters, it melted a little as I worked on LDAP and it melted a little more as I tried to trick Eric into working on filters with me (yes, that actually worked :-).
Anyway, as usual, this is just going to be a summary of what we did as tons of little stuff have been committed here and there.</div></a><a class="article block px-3 py-4 hover:bg-slate-200 dark:hover:bg-slate-700" href=/posts/2012-12-07/opensmtpd-fully-virtual-setups-updated-dns-mta-code-sqlite-support/><h3 class="text-lg font-semibold mb-0.5">OpenSMTPD: fully virtual setups, updated DNS & MTA code, SQLite support</h3><div class="text-sm text-slate-500 dark:text-slate-400 line-clamp-2">OHAI,
This week I had intended to work on filters. After 3 days of pain and swearing, even though it did move forward, I finally decided to step back for a few days and work on something else to preserve my sanity.
As you may have guessed, this week has not been too productive&mldr; Oh wait, yes it has ! It&rsquo;s actually been incredibly productive :-)
Just as usual, I will only write a summary for this week, the complete changelog can be retrieved from our mirror on Github.</div></a><a class="article block px-3 py-4 hover:bg-slate-200 dark:hover:bg-slate-700" href=/posts/2012-11-30/opensmtpd-more-features-more-cleanup-more-more/><h3 class="text-lg font-semibold mb-0.5">OpenSMTPD: more features, more cleanup, more more</h3><div class="text-sm text-slate-500 dark:text-slate-400 line-clamp-2">OHAI,
First of all, on a completely unrelated note, I&rsquo;d like to emphasize that this blog post is being written from my text editor launched by a little shell and pushed to poolp using the Ocean API. I can be web2.0 from console and emacs, and that&rsquo;s definitely worth a mention ;-)
As has become a habit, a lot of work has been poured in OpenSMTPD this week, here is an incomplete summary of the most notable changes.</div></a><a class="article block px-3 py-4 hover:bg-slate-200 dark:hover:bg-slate-700" href=/posts/2012-11-17/news-from-the-front/><h3 class="text-lg font-semibold mb-0.5">News from the front</h3><div class="text-sm text-slate-500 dark:text-slate-400 line-clamp-2">Almost a month since my last post&mldr; I know, I know.
So I left my position at Scality two weeks ago. I had been there for a year and a half working on a very interesting and tricky project. I will miss my colleagues and the discussions we had on all kinds of topic, I hope them the best future and that we will be able to share beers again ;-)</div></a><a class="article block px-3 py-4 hover:bg-slate-200 dark:hover:bg-slate-700" href=/posts/2012-08-31/opensmtpd-crypto/compress-fixes-and-import-initial-stab-at-ldap/><h3 class="text-lg font-semibold mb-0.5">OpenSMTPD: crypto/compress fixes and import initial stab at LDAP</h3><div class="text-sm text-slate-500 dark:text-slate-400 line-clamp-2">The crypto backend that has been committed a couple days ago started a little discussion and it was decided to switch the default cipher from Blowfish to AES-128 and make it a default.
Encryption can now be enabled as simply as:
queue encryption key &ldquo;foobar&rdquo;
That being said, Charles cleaned up a bit the compression code to make it use FILE* instead of file descriptors. This allows us to ensure we don&rsquo;t have to deal with any buffering and interruption handling code.</div></a><a class="article block px-3 py-4 hover:bg-slate-200 dark:hover:bg-slate-700" href=/posts/2012-08-29/opensmtpd-crypto_backend-and-encrypted-queue/><h3 class="text-lg font-semibold mb-0.5">OpenSMTPD: crypto_backend and encrypted queue</h3><div class="text-sm text-slate-500 dark:text-slate-400 line-clamp-2">A few days ago, Charles committed the compress_backend API which allowed transparent deflation/inflation of envelopes and messages as they hit the queue.
The compression code is executed before the queue_backend gets the data so that any queue_backend can benefit transparently from compression without having to add any code to handle it. Due to our design, this also means that if the queue_backend stores envelopes and messages remotely, then the compression will take place before sending and after fetching, the remote end only ever sees compressed data.</div></a><a class="article block px-3 py-4 hover:bg-slate-200 dark:hover:bg-slate-700" href=/posts/2012-08-26/opensmtpd-i-have-no-idea-for-that-title-sorry/><h3 class="text-lg font-semibold mb-0.5">OpenSMTPD: I have no idea for that title, sorry</h3><div class="text-sm text-slate-500 dark:text-slate-400 line-clamp-2">Howdie,
Eric and I had planned a loooooong time ago to have a hackathon this week-end. However, some asshole piece of shit ran into my car while it was parked, made it unable to take the road and flee without leaving a note. Long story made short, I had to be at the repair shop this week-end to be able to get my car before end of September.
We did get our hackathon though and while it was probably much less productive than if we had met in the same room, it was still very very interesting with tons of improvements and many great features written :-p</div></a><a class="article block px-3 py-4 hover:bg-slate-200 dark:hover:bg-slate-700" href=/posts/2012-08-21/opensmtpd-plenty-of-news/><h3 class="text-lg font-semibold mb-0.5">OpenSMTPD: plenty of news</h3><div class="text-sm text-slate-500 dark:text-slate-400 line-clamp-2">It&rsquo;s been over a month since my last post but I have an excuse: I was super busy, then I was super on vacation &mldr; but I&rsquo;m back again ;-)
So my life was pretty intense these last few weeks, both professionnally and on the opensource front. I&rsquo;ll explain later, for now let&rsquo;s just focus on the OpenSMTPD goodies.
OpenSMTPD portable to a new system First of all, I&rsquo;d like to stress out that Rune Lynge and Charles Longeau did an amazing job at porting OpenSMTPD to yet another system &mldr; MacOSX.</div></a><a class="article block px-3 py-4 hover:bg-slate-200 dark:hover:bg-slate-700" href=/posts/2012-07-15/g2k12-openbsd-hackathon-part-ii/><h3 class="text-lg font-semibold mb-0.5">g2k12: OpenBSD hackathon - part II</h3><div class="text-sm text-slate-500 dark:text-slate-400 line-clamp-2">Yesterday, I came back from Budapest and was too tired to write anything, but here&rsquo;s a quick summary of all the features that have been implemented with regard to OpenSMTPD by Eric, Charles and I.
First of all, Eric [eric@] has moved ASR, his asynchronous resolver, to OpenBSD&rsquo;s libc. This is a huge step forward that will allow OpenSMTPD to contain less code, while providing a better coverage of the resolver code.</div></a><a class="article block px-3 py-4 hover:bg-slate-200 dark:hover:bg-slate-700" href=/posts/2012-07-09/g2k12-openbsd-hackathon/><h3 class="text-lg font-semibold mb-0.5">g2k12: OpenBSD hackathon</h3><div class="text-sm text-slate-500 dark:text-slate-400 line-clamp-2">Yesterday, after nearly missing my plane by 5 minutes, I finally managed to make it to Budapest for g2k12, the OpenBSD general hackathon.
While this is not my first hackathon, this is the first general one with many hackers working on all kinds of subsystems ranging from ports to network and kernel. It&rsquo;s fun to see many people focused on improving different areas which you use daily, sometimes without even noticing, and doing it with as much fun as you are having fixing your own area ;-)</div></a><a class="article block px-3 py-4 hover:bg-slate-200 dark:hover:bg-slate-700" href=/posts/2012-06-19/opensmtpd-development-bug-tracker-github/><h3 class="text-lg font-semibold mb-0.5">OpenSMTPD: development, bug tracker & GitHub</h3><div class="text-sm text-slate-500 dark:text-slate-400 line-clamp-2">It&rsquo;s been a while since my last post about OpenSMTPD.
I don&rsquo;t know what Eric and Charles have been up to, I was quite busy with my daytime job and couldn&rsquo;t really spend much time on the hobby ;-)
Anyways, one of the most requested feature of OpenSMTPD is to provide users with a mean to report bugs and let them contribute more easily. It&rsquo;s been requested two times this week, it&rsquo;s been requested countless times in the last few weeks and months, and as a matter of fact it&rsquo;s also been a nuisance for us as until now we&rsquo;ve kept track of bugs and feature requests in my mailbox.</div></a><a class="article block px-3 py-4 hover:bg-slate-200 dark:hover:bg-slate-700" href=/posts/2012-06-06/opensmtpd-rest-queue/><h3 class="text-lg font-semibold mb-0.5">OpenSMTPD REST queue</h3><div class="text-sm text-slate-500 dark:text-slate-400 line-clamp-2">This is the first post of a series to illustrate and describe a &ldquo;proof of concept&rdquo; code by Charles, Eric and I. I will describe the features as they are implemented.
Since mid-November 2011, OpenSMTPD offers support for an extensible queue API. The queue_backend API allows a developer to write a custom storage driver by implementing a small set of functions that take care of storing, updating and removing envelopes and messages.</div></a><a class="article block px-3 py-4 hover:bg-slate-200 dark:hover:bg-slate-700" href=/posts/2012-05-17/opensmtpd-src-address-maps-and-spamhaus/><h3 class="text-lg font-semibold mb-0.5">OpenSMTPD: src-address maps and spamhaus</h3><div class="text-sm text-slate-500 dark:text-slate-400 line-clamp-2">First of all, I&rsquo;d like to &ldquo;thank&rdquo; The Spamhaus project which forced me into hacking this feature in a hurry.
See, I rent a server at online.net which I use for OpenSMTPD live testing and to run some experimental code before it hits the OpenBSD tree.
Yesterday I received a mail from a user complaining that he couldn&rsquo;t send mail to a friend because we were listed on spamhaus. That was very strange because ALL users at poolp.</div></a><a class="article block px-3 py-4 hover:bg-slate-200 dark:hover:bg-slate-700" href=/posts/2012-05-14/opensmtpd-relay-maps-new-url-syntax/><h3 class="text-lg font-semibold mb-0.5">OpenSMTPD relay maps & new url syntax</h3><div class="text-sm text-slate-500 dark:text-slate-400 line-clamp-2">When we first started working on OpenSMTPD, we planned for future features but we did not necessarily start integrating them right away as the goal was to bootstrap the project first with basic features.
Amongst these features was the ability to use mappings for outgoing MX servers. Currently, OpenSMTPD knows two ways of going out:
Using the DNS system to find MX records: accept for [&mldr;] relay
Using the provided mail exchanger: accept for [&mldr;] relay via &ldquo;my-mx.</div></a><a class="article block px-3 py-4 hover:bg-slate-200 dark:hover:bg-slate-700" href=/posts/2012-05-13/opensmtpd-map_compare-and-k_netaddr/><h3 class="text-lg font-semibold mb-0.5">OpenSMTPD, map_compare() and K_NETADDR</h3><div class="text-sm text-slate-500 dark:text-slate-400 line-clamp-2">Ok, I already posted about the new SQLite map_backend earlier today but it turns out that I&rsquo;ve been very productive, and it was worth another post ;-)
So I decided to start improving our maps support and make them usable from places where they weren&rsquo;t.
primary domains
OpenSMTPD supports two kinds of domains: primary domains and virtual domains. The primary domains do not require providing a list of recipients as it will use system accounts; whereas virtual domains require a list of recipients and/or a fallback address to be provided within a map.</div></a><a class="article block px-3 py-4 hover:bg-slate-200 dark:hover:bg-slate-700" href=/posts/2012-05-12/opensmtpd-meets-sqlite/><h3 class="text-lg font-semibold mb-0.5">OpenSMTPD meets SQLite</h3><div class="text-sm text-slate-500 dark:text-slate-400 line-clamp-2">During the r2k12 hackathon in Paris, Marc Espie committed SQLite to OpenBSD&rsquo;s base system.
This has the side effect that OpenSMTPD can start using it and while we agreed that we did not want it as a strong dependency, the various backends API allow us to make it a soft dependency that can be removed without breaking the daemon if someone really does not want SQLite linked.
Today I decided to give it a try and implement a SQLite backend to the map API.</div></a><a class="article block px-3 py-4 hover:bg-slate-200 dark:hover:bg-slate-700" href=/posts/2012-05-09/some-opensmtpd-news/><h3 class="text-lg font-semibold mb-0.5">Some OpenSMTPD news</h3><div class="text-sm text-slate-500 dark:text-slate-400 line-clamp-2">It&rsquo;s been a whiiiiiiile since my last OpenSMTPD related post. Time to break the slacking, blog-wise.
Unlike what would appear from the outside, there&rsquo;s been a lot of activity, discussions and planning, I&rsquo;ll address some here and will discuss it further soon.
First of all, chl@ has committed to a private branch a major improvement to the filter API: async DNS lookups. Due to the design of OpenSMTPD, it is not acceptable for a filter to perform a blocking call as it will prevent it from processing other sessions.</div></a><a class="article block px-3 py-4 hover:bg-slate-200 dark:hover:bg-slate-700" href=/posts/2005-05-21/fatigue-et-envie-de-vacances.../><h3 class="text-lg font-semibold mb-0.5">fatigue et envie de vacances...</h3><div class="text-sm text-slate-500 dark:text-slate-400 line-clamp-2">Je sais pas pourquoi, mais je suis epuise alors que j&rsquo;ai dormi pres de 14h cette nuit.

helped test a diff for a <strong>reproducible crash</strong> in the <strong>new libtls code</strong> on my machines,
and shared some of my nooSMTPD diffs with <code>eric@</code> so he could decide to reuse them or not in OpenSMTPD.</p><p>With OpenBSD 6.9 coming out,
<strong>OpenSMTPD 6.9.0 was tagged</strong> and <code>eric@</code> asked me if I could <strong>synchronize the OpenSMTPD portable repository</strong> so it matches OpenBSD.
I spent a few hours bringing back <strong>every individual commit</strong>,
<strong>fixing conflicts</strong> and ended up with a <strong>libtls-powered</strong> OpenSMTPD-portable which &mldr; didn&rsquo;t build anywhere because <strong>the world still uses OpenSSL</strong>.</p><p>Since I had already dealt with this in nooSMTPD,
I brought back my <strong>libtls compat layer</strong> so that on systems with OpenSSL the compat layer allows <strong>using the libtls interface on top of OpenSSL</strong>.
This fixed the CI for <strong>Ubuntu and Fedora</strong>,
unfortunately the CI for <strong>Alpine and ArchLinux</strong> uses LibreSSL and remain broken until the latest LibreSSL is packaged there.</p><p>Because the libtls conversion is such a major change,
there will be a <strong>delay</strong> between the time OpenSMTPD is released for <strong>OpenBSD</strong> users and the time it is released for <strong>other systems</strong>:
the change to the libtls interface has been heavily tested and I&rsquo;ve been running it for a while now,
but the portable adaptation of it has been <strong>virtually untested</strong>.

It is <strong>the snapshots themselves</strong> that are encrypted on an <strong>individual basis</strong> and the same plakar can host both encrypted and cleartext snapshots.</p><p>With the second approach, <strong>a plakar repository is initialized as encrypted or cleartext</strong>.
The snapshots are automatically encrypted if needed and the same plakar ony hosts all encrypted or all cleartext snapshots.</p><p>I played with both but decided to go with the <strong>second approach</strong> because the first one came with additional unnecessary complexity.</p><h2 id=encryption-macro-details>encryption macro-details</h2><p>A user generates a <strong><code>P384</code> keypair</strong> as well as a <strong>random master key</strong>,

<a href=https://github.com/poolpOrg/filter-senderscore target=_blank rel=noopener>filter-senderscore</a> two years ago,
but never really dived into the language more than these two small projects because I still have some <strong>love-hate issues</strong> with some aspects of it.</p><p>I decided this month to get more familiar with it and started looking at what it would take to write a tiny daemon,
not just a program that runs an endless loop and does all work in the same process,
but one that does things the OpenBSD style with privileges separation,
message passing and fd passing.</p><p>I was not <strong>disappointed</strong>:
there&rsquo;s not much out there to do that.</p><h2 id=go-ipcmsg>go-ipcmsg</h2><p>The first thing that is missing is a package that provides something like the <code>imsg(3)</code> framework.</p><p>For those not familiar with it,
the <code>imsg(3)</code> framework provides functions that allow two processes to exchange messages,
<strong>including file descriptors</strong>,
while guaranteeing that messages are always received whole.</p><p>Typically,
you will create a <code>socketpair(2)</code> before <code>fork(2)</code>-ing a process.
The parent and the child will both use one end of the pair to communicate with each other,
using the <code>imsg(3)</code> framework that will take care of buffering I/O and exposing full messages to receiving end.</p><p>There are a lot of gory details on how it achieves this and requires understanding iovec,
the semantic of <code>sendmsg(2)</code> and <code>recvmsg(2)</code>,
how control messages and SCM_RIGHTS works,
as well as some of the side effets of cmsgbuf alignments.
I did a bit of work related to resources exhaustion there a few years ago and,
while the interface is lovely,
I can&rsquo;t say I really missed diving in that code.</p><p>When I figured that there was nothing similar in Go,
I started reproducing the <code>imsg(3)</code> API but realized that while the API was fine in C,
it could be made <strong>much simpler in Go</strong> using the language-provided <strong>channels</strong> and <strong>goroutines</strong>.</p><p>So I wrote a <code>Channel</code> struct which creates two channels,
one for reads and one for writes,
and associates them to a <code>socketpair(2)</code> end:</p><div class=highlight><pre tabindex=0 style=color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#282a36;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4><code class=language-go data-lang=go><span style=display:flex><span><span style=color:#6272a4>// parent process main routine, forks a child then sets up an ipcmsg

I would <strong>LOVE</strong> to receive testing feedbacks though !</p><h2 id=go-privsep>go-privsep</h2><p>The second thing missing is the ability to easily do privileges separation,
that is <strong>creating multiple processes</strong> that are <strong>inherited from a parent process</strong> with <strong>different privileges</strong>,
and have the ability to <strong>communicate one with another</strong>.</p><p>On OpenBSD,
daemons follow the <strong>fork+reexec</strong> pattern which boils down to the following:</p><p>The daemon is started,
it forks all of its child processes after setting up the plumbing for communicating with them,
and each child process re-executes itself so that it benefits from ASLR and doesn&rsquo;t retain the memory layout of the parent process.</p><p>This is an <strong>improvement</strong> over the more widely used fork pattern,
where each child inherits from parent,
because <strong>the reexec causes all inherited data to be lost</strong>.
It prevents inheriting sensitive information by accident at the cost of forcing the parent to send back the necessary information to each process.
And again, it makes all child processes benefit from ASLR too which is nice.</p><p>This pattern was popularized in OpenBSD <strong>a few years ago</strong>,
long after many of the daemons were already in place,
so each one did what it could to make it happen.
There was <strong>no attempt at unifying this through a framework</strong> like was done for IPC and <code>imsg(3)</code>.</p><p>Since I had a good understanding of how to do that and no framework to inspire myself,
I worked on a <code>privsep</code> package that would make it easier to write such daemons.
The idea is that a daemon will describe the different processes that compose it,
as well as the communication channels between them,
and the <code>privsep</code> package will then handle all the plumbing so that processes are created according to expectations.</p><p>Here is a simple example of how it works:</p><div class=highlight><pre tabindex=0 style=color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#282a36;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4><code class=language-go data-lang=go><span style=display:flex><span><span style=color:#ff79c6>package</span> main

it uses the <code>ipcmsg</code> package to handle IPC between the two processes,
allowing my <code>pingpong</code> daemon to play ping pong indefinitely.
Each process can have <strong>more specific settings</strong> set so that it runs under a <strong>specific user</strong>,
a <strong>specific group</strong> or from a <strong><code>chroot(2)</code> jail</strong>.</p><p>I still have <strong>a lot of work</strong> to do on this,
but I commited the <a href=https://github.com/poolpOrg/privsep target=_blank rel=noopener>current state on Github</a> anyways.</p><h1 id=small-talk-on-hypnosis>small talk on hypnosis</h1><p>This is <strong>not tech related</strong> but since my other main activity is hypnosis and hypnotherapy,
I spent a bit of time this month working on a 3-hours talk I gave to a community of street hypnotists and hypnotherapists in Nantes.</p><p>I&rsquo;ve been working these last three months on a model to <strong>describe the organization of the psychic apparatus</strong>,
based on what I learnt, experienced and observed these last six years from hundreds of hypnosis sessions,
tons of psychology readings and many experiments in lucid dreaming.</p><p>The model describes how the psychic apparatus organization <strong>changes with the altered state of consciousness</strong> of a subject and what it means in terms of <strong>access to the subconscious and repressed psychic content</strong>.</p><p>This is <strong>not limited to hypnosis</strong> as it can be used to evaluate if a particular kind of therapy even makes sense,
but applied to hypnosis it is particularly useful to <strong>understand resistance</strong>,
what is happening in a subject when a technique is used,
what is happening when a technique isn&rsquo;t working,
and how to <strong>bring the subject to the proper state of consciousness</strong>.</p><p>I don&rsquo;t think this post is the right place to dive into details and,
well,
the talk lasted 3 hours and it was very superficial so I will stop there.
If people are interested in this topic,
let me know and I&rsquo;ll think of a way to present this as the slides I presented are not really informative without me talking over them.</p><h1 id=whats-next->What&rsquo;s next ?</h1><p>Not much.</p><p>May will be a calm month for me here as the <strong>sponsoring has decreased</strong> and I need to <strong>do some freelance</strong> to buy myself <strong>spare time</strong> in June/July.
Furthermore,
I have had to deal with some personal issues in April and I&rsquo;m not in the mood to do a lot of stuff at the moment.</p><p>I&rsquo;ll probably do a few things,
as usual,
but I&rsquo;m not sure what at this point as it depends on how much time I&rsquo;ll have available and how my mood evolves.</p><hr><p>Comments: <a href=https://github.com/poolpOrg/poolp.org/discussions/129 target=_blank rel=noopener>https://github.com/poolpOrg/poolp.org/discussions/129</a></p><script src=https://giscus.app/client.js data-repo=poolpOrg/poolp.org data-repo-id="MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMjYxODk2MjA=" data-category=Articles data-category-id=DIC_kwDOB4WANM4B-Zf1 data-mapping=og:title data-strict=0 data-reactions-enabled=1 data-emit-metadata=1 data-input-position=top data-theme=light data-lang=en data-loading=lazy crossorigin=anonymous async></script></article></div></div><script type=text/javascript src=/main.js defer></script></body></html>
