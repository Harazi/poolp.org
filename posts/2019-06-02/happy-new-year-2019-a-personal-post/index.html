I&rsquo;ve been diagnosed with generalized anxiety disorder and alexithymia a couple weeks apart.</p><p>The anxiety disorder didn&rsquo;t really come as a surprise as I know very well the traumatic experience that led to the disorder.
It&rsquo;ll still take a lot of hours of hypnosis to continue cleaning up trauma after trauma,
but taking care of it and releasing some of the traumas has improved considerably my anxiety.</p><p>I&rsquo;ve also tried different approaches out of curiosity,
including consumption of increasing doses of CBD in various forms,
but didn&rsquo;t observe noticeable improvements no matter if smoked, vaped, eaten, tinctured, &mldr;
it does help sleep earlier if I consume a large dose of CBD but only hypnosis relieves anxiety effectively for me.</p><p>The alexithymia diagnosis crushed me for a while.
I didn&rsquo;t know what it was but as the psychologist explained the disorder,
all of the implications throughout the years hit me in the face very harshly.</p><p>Alexithymia is an inability to identify and describe emotions in the self.
I learnt at 38 that I&rsquo;m mostly cut from emotions and that when people say &ldquo;I feel happy&rdquo; or &ldquo;I feel sad&rdquo; they actually feel it,
whereas I will say that I feel them when I &ldquo;know&rdquo; I should feel them,
not because I <em>actually</em> feel them.</p><p>I won&rsquo;t enter much more details as it still makes me uncomfortable at this point,
but one of the side-effects of alexithymia is that it makes the anxiety disorder considerably worse:
I cannot see attacks coming and can&rsquo;t use any techniques to prevent them from unfolding.
In most situations I will not even realize that I&rsquo;m having an anxiety attack but will still suffer from all of its symptoms without being able to make a connection,
nor understand what is happening.</p><p>I wish I had read about this earlier and put some sense into it earlier,
which is why I&rsquo;m taking a few paragraphs to explain and will answer any question in the comments if you have some.
I will probably write again about it in the future but I don&rsquo;t think GAD or alexithymia characterize me,
they haven&rsquo;t prevented me from having a career or hobbies though they made it considerably harder,
so I will not give them a bigger place than they already have in my every day life,
it won&rsquo;t be a recurrent topic.</p><p>I&rsquo;d say it&rsquo;s been an emotional rollercoaster but now you know I don&rsquo;t really grasp what it means :-)</p><h2 id=other-misc-personal-stuff>Other misc. personal stuff</h2><p>In just a few months,
I learnt my half was pregnant and we&rsquo;re expecting a little guy in October &lt;3,
we moved to our own place that we&rsquo;ve been waiting for two years to be built,
my cat died after sharing sixteen years with me,
I fully completed my final hypnotherapist training putting an end to years of training,
and mostly finished my third year of studying occupational clinical psychology.</p><p>I have also changed role at work and requested to switch to a 75% part-time job,
spending three weeks at work for one week off to work on my projects,
both open-source and hypno/psycho related.</p><p>Life has been busy and kept me away from writing here.</p><h2 id=what-next->What next ?</h2><p>Now that I will be able to spend one week off each month,
I&rsquo;ll write a monthly report of my activities on this blog,
this will be an easier rythm than writing whenever I do something.</p><p>This post was not the May monthly report,
which I&rsquo;ll write right after and publish tonight,
I just wanted to get the non-technical stuff out of the way.</p><p>Cheers,
Gilles</p><hr><p>Comments: <a href=https://github.com/poolpOrg/poolp.org/issues/56>https://github.com/poolpOrg/poolp.org/issues/56</a></p></div><div class=after-post-tags><ul class=tags></ul></div><div class="row PageNavigation d-flex justify-content-between font-weight-bold"><a class="d-block col-md-6" href=https://poolp.org/posts/2019-06-30/june-2019-report-fion-bpg-and-smtpd/>&#171; June 2019 report: fion, bpg and smtpd</a>
