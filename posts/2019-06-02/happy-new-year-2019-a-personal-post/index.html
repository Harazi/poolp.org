Way too many things happened in a six months timeframe.
This post won't need a TL;DR as I'll keep it short.
</code></pre><h2 id=generalized-anxiety-disorder-and-alexithymia>Generalized anxiety disorder and alexithymia.</h2><p>Late 2018,
I&rsquo;ve been diagnosed with generalized anxiety disorder and alexithymia a couple weeks apart.</p><p>The anxiety disorder didn&rsquo;t really come as a surprise as I know very well the traumatic experience that led to the disorder.
It&rsquo;ll still take a lot of hours of hypnosis to continue cleaning up trauma after trauma,
but taking care of it and releasing some of the traumas has improved considerably my anxiety.</p><p>I&rsquo;ve also tried different approaches out of curiosity,
including consumption of increasing doses of CBD in various forms,
but didn&rsquo;t observe noticeable improvements no matter if smoked, vaped, eaten, tinctured, &mldr;
it does help sleep earlier if I consume a large dose of CBD but only hypnosis relieves anxiety effectively for me.</p><p>The alexithymia diagnosis crushed me for a while.
I didn&rsquo;t know what it was but as the psychologist explained the disorder,
all of the implications throughout the years hit me in the face very harshly.</p><p>Alexithymia is an inability to identify and describe emotions in the self.
I learnt at 38 that I&rsquo;m mostly cut from emotions and that when people say &ldquo;I feel happy&rdquo; or &ldquo;I feel sad&rdquo; they actually feel it,
whereas I will say that I feel them when I &ldquo;know&rdquo; I should feel them,
not because I <em>actually</em> feel them.</p><p>I won&rsquo;t enter much more details as it still makes me uncomfortable at this point,
but one of the side-effects of alexithymia is that it makes the anxiety disorder considerably worse:
I cannot see attacks coming and can&rsquo;t use any techniques to prevent them from unfolding.
In most situations I will not even realize that I&rsquo;m having an anxiety attack but will still suffer from all of its symptoms without being able to make a connection,
nor understand what is happening.</p><p>I wish I had read about this earlier and put some sense into it earlier,
which is why I&rsquo;m taking a few paragraphs to explain and will answer any question in the comments if you have some.
I will probably write again about it in the future but I don&rsquo;t think GAD or alexithymia characterize me,
they haven&rsquo;t prevented me from having a career or hobbies though they made it considerably harder,
so I will not give them a bigger place than they already have in my every day life,
it won&rsquo;t be a recurrent topic.</p><p>I&rsquo;d say it&rsquo;s been an emotional rollercoaster but now you know I don&rsquo;t really grasp what it means :-)</p><h2 id=other-misc-personal-stuff>Other misc. personal stuff</h2><p>In just a few months,
I learnt my half was pregnant and we&rsquo;re expecting a little guy in October &lt;3,
we moved to our own place that we&rsquo;ve been waiting for two years to be built,
my cat died after sharing sixteen years with me,
I fully completed my final hypnotherapist training putting an end to years of training,
and mostly finished my third year of studying occupational clinical psychology.</p><p>I have also changed role at work and requested to switch to a 75% part-time job,
spending three weeks at work for one week off to work on my projects,
both open-source and hypno/psycho related.</p><p>Life has been busy and kept me away from writing here.</p><h2 id=what-next->What next ?</h2><p>Now that I will be able to spend one week off each month,
I&rsquo;ll write a monthly report of my activities on this blog,
this will be an easier rythm than writing whenever I do something.</p><p>This post was not the May monthly report,
which I&rsquo;ll write right after and publish tonight,
I just wanted to get the non-technical stuff out of the way.</p><p>Cheers,
Gilles</p><hr><p>Comments: <a href=https://github.com/poolpOrg/poolp.org/issues/56>https://github.com/poolpOrg/poolp.org/issues/56</a></p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=https%3a%2f%2fpoolp.org%2fposts%2f2019-06-02%2fhappy-new-year-2019-a-personal-post%2f&text=happy%20new%20year%202019%2c%20a%20personal%20post&via=poolpOrg" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=https%3a%2f%2fpoolp.org%2fposts%2f2019-06-02%2fhappy-new-year-2019-a-personal-post%2f" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=https%3a%2f%2fpoolp.org%2fposts%2f2019-06-02%2fhappy-new-year-2019-a-personal-post%2f&title=happy%20new%20year%202019%2c%20a%20personal%20post" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=https%3a%2f%2fpoolp.org%2fposts%2f2019-06-02%2fhappy-new-year-2019-a-personal-post%2f&title=happy%20new%20year%202019%2c%20a%20personal%20post" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=https%3a%2f%2fpoolp.org%2fposts%2f2019-06-02%2fhappy-new-year-2019-a-personal-post%2f&title=happy%20new%20year%202019%2c%20a%20personal%20post" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=https%3a%2f%2fpoolp.org%2fposts%2f2019-06-02%2fhappy-new-year-2019-a-personal-post%2f&description=happy%20new%20year%202019%2c%20a%20personal%20post" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=https://poolp.org/posts/2018-12-21/opensmtpd-now-supports-regex-in-match-rules/ data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="OpenSMTPD now supports regex in match rules">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=https://poolp.org/posts/2019-06-02/may-2019-report/ data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="May 2019 report">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer style=text-align:justify><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><h2>Like my work and want to help me ?</h2><br><ul><li>Consider <b>tipping me</b> on <b><a target=_blank href=https://paypal.me/poolpOrg>PayPal</a></b>,
