This was strange because each one worked fine and their output was correct but somehow the combination led to errors. I tracked it down and figured that the reuse of the same buffer led to an overlap which didn&rsquo;t happen before the switch to aes-256-gcm but would completely corrupt decryption now. Using two separate buffers for the compression and encryption was enough to solve this.</p><p>Then, I realized that while everything was working flawlessly at runtime, OpenSMTPD would fail to load envelope at startup. After some tracking I isolated the bug to the queue_fsqueue.c backend which was violating API layers by trying to validate the envelope content while it should be done by the upper layer after decryption/decompression. The fix seemed tricky at first but was really about 10 lines to end up with.</p><p>As of my sandbox, I currently have an OpenSMTPD that runs with the following configuration file: listen on lo0</p><p>queue compression</p><p>generate key with: openssl rand -hex 16
queue encryption key 95ca5f8053fc2baca7c390bea62bd9e2</p><p>accept from any for domain poolp.org deliver to maildir accept for any relay All it lacks is better smtpctl integration so that we can &ldquo;smtpctl show envelope&rdquo; on an encrypted envelope :-)</p><p>table_proc API</p><p>A feature I have wanted for many months is the ability to externalize table backends so that we can write very funky backends with dependencies that are never going to make it to the OpenBSD tree.</p><p>For example, people are going to want to store their aliases in mysql or pgsql and while the feature is easy to achieve thanks to the table API, we can&rsquo;t provide it out of the box because of the dependencies AND people can&rsquo;t contribute it easily because tables are part of the daemon and will require rebuilding after some patching.</p><p>So what I wanted was to have table backends work like our filters: they are standalone programs that are executed at startup by OpenSMTPD and communication takes place through the imsg(3) framework.</p><p>Eric took that idea, improved it and made a working implementation. So now, one can write a custom backend without having us do anything on our side, with whatever dependencies wanted, and OpenSMTPD can make use of it by providing the path in the configuration file:</p><p>table aliases &ldquo;proc:/usr/libexec/smtpd/backend-table-sqlite -f /etc/mail/sqlite.conf /etc/mail/sqlite-aliases.db&rdquo;</p><p>listen on lo0</p><p>accept from any for domain poolp.org alias deliver to maildir accept for any relay</p><p>Writing a custom backend implementation is very simple, fill in the blanks: /* * Copyright (c) 2013 Eric Faurot <a href=mailto:eric@openbsd.org>eric@openbsd.org</a> * * Permission to use, copy, modify, and distribute this software for any * purpose with or without fee is hereby granted, provided that the above * copyright notice and this permission notice appear in all copies. * * THE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED &ldquo;AS IS&rdquo; AND THE AUTHOR DISCLAIMS ALL WARRANTIES * WITH REGARD TO THIS SOFTWARE INCLUDING ALL IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF * MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS.

Currently, if an admin edits manually an envelope and fucks up, the daemon will abort.</p><p>I also found a missing check within the imsg API that can cause OpenSMTPD and possibly other daemons to fatal() under some situations.
