title: "Hire me !"
---
In February 2019,
I switched to a **75% part-time schedule** so that I could spend **one week each month** working on my own stuff at the cost of **slashing a quarter of my wage**.

These weeks are mostly used to work on opensource software and write articles,
but from time to time I take **<font color="red">short freelance missions</font>** to cover the loss in my finances.

If your company could [make use of my skills](https://github.com/poolpOrg/resume/blob/master/resume.en.pdf),
related to my own projects or not,
don't hesitate to [contact me](mailto:gilles@poolp.org).

My average rate is either **150EUR** per hour or **650EUR** per day (~= 8 hours),
and **may be readjusted** based on the project and ability to opensource parts or entire work.
